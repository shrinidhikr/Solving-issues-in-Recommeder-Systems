Using Blackwood's publication ledgers, it also establishes the details of the eleven complete or nearly complete resettings of the novel in Eliot's lifetime; and examines the author's revisions to a manuscript that is popularly, but erroneously, thought to have been little altered, giving detailed attention to the dialect in the context of more than 900 variants between manuscript and first edition.",Fiction  ,Adam Bede

Thomas Chris D.,"THE TIMES, ECONOMIST AND GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2017 It is accepted wisdom today that human beings have irrevocably damaged the natural world. Yet what if this narrative obscures a more hopeful truth? In Inheritors of the Earth, renowned ecologist and environmentalist Chris D. Thomas overturns the accepted story, revealing how nature is fighting back. Many animals and plants actually benefit from our presence, raising biological diversity in most parts of the world and increasing the rate at which new species are formed, perhaps to the highest level in Earth's history. From Costa Rican tropical forests to the thoroughly transformed British landscape, nature is coping surprisingly well in the human epoch. Chris Thomas takes us on a gripping round-the-world journey to meet the enterprising creatures that are thriving in the Anthropocene, from York's ochre-coloured comma butterfly to hybrid bison in North America, scarlet-beaked pukekos in New Zealand, and Asian palms forming thickets in the European Alps. In so doing, he questions our irrational persecution of so-called 'invasive species', and shows us that we should not treat the Earth as a faded masterpiece that we need to restore. After all, if life can recover from the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, might it not be able to survive the onslaughts of a technological ape? Combining a naturalist's eye for wildlife with an ecologist's wide lens, Chris Thomas forces us to re-examine humanity's relationship with nature, and reminds us that the story of life is the story of change.",Science  ,Inheritors of the Earth

Anderson Jon Lee,"Che Guevara's legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of 39, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally famed icon, as revered as he is controversial. A Marxist ideologue, he sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare - and has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of change. In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and Jose Hernandez reveal the man behind the myth, creating a complex portrait of this passionate idealist.

Through renowned Mexican artist Jose Hernandez's drawings, we feel the bullets fly past in Cuba; smell the smoke of Castro's cigars; and scrutinize the face of the weary guerrilla as he is called 'Comandante' for the first time. With astonishing precision, colour, and drama, Che makes us first-hand witnesses to the revolutionary life and times of this historic figure.

Tor Udall, author of `A Thousand Paper Birds' Emma did not go to war looking for love, but Adam is unlike any other. Under the secret shadow of trauma, Emma decides to leave Iraq and joins Adam to settle in Colorado. But isolation and fear find her, once again, when Adam is re-deployed. Torn between a deep fear for Adam's safety and a desire to be back there herself, Emma copes by throwing herself into a new role mentoring an Iraqi refugee family. But when Adam comes home, he brings the conflict back with him. Emma had considered the possibility that her husband might not come home from war. She had not considered that he might return a stranger. What Reviewers and Readers are saying: `An astounding debut, Pieces of Me is a beautiful book written with emotion and compassion and will stay with me for a long time. It's characters and story tugged at my heart with every turning page.' Nina Pottell, Books Editor, Prima Magazine `Heart-wrenching and heart-warming in equal measure, Pieces of Me is an incredibly moving tale of love and conflict.

Hart tells this devastating story beautifully' Laura Pearson, author of Missing Pieces `Pieces of Me churns with love and rage and hope and terror, as only the best war books can. Natalie Hart writes like a born storyteller, and she uses that gift here to explore how the Iraq War lingers in the dark corners of souls desperate to move on from it. Readers are in for a ride' Matt Gallagher, author of Youngblood `Pieces of Me is a quietly powerful exploration of the complex effects of the Iraq war...The novel builds in power and speaks authoritatively on the polarisation of the lives changed forever by conflict' Zoe Lambert `Natalie Hart's brilliant Pieces of Me is-like Graham Greene's The End of the Affair-a love story set amid the ruins of war. As a British civilian who meets her American husband in Iraq, the narrator, Emma McLaughlin, is a first-hand witness to the ways armed conflict breaks soldiers and non-combatants alike. Her testimony, and this novel, is unforgettably complex and devastating-as it should be' Whitney Terrell, author of The Good Lieutenant `Natalie Hart's vivid novel, Pieces of Me, examines the lives of deployed soldiers' families and displaced Iraqi civilians, eloquently revealing how even the most tightly knit relationships can unravel under the stress of war' Siobhan Fallon, author of You Know When the Men Are Gone and The Confusion of Languages",Fiction  ,Pieces of Me - Shortlisted for Costa First Novel Award

Chambers Robert W.,"With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies. 'I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled with horror which at all times assails me yet'. With its strange, imaginative blend of horror, science fiction, romance and lyrical prose, Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow is a classic masterpiece of weird fiction. This series of vaguely connected stories is linked by the presence of a monstrous and suppressed book which brings fright, madness and spectral tragedy to all those who read it. An air of futility and doom pervade these pages like a sweet insidious poison. Dare you read it? This collection has been called the most important book in American supernatural fiction between Poe and the moderns. H. P. Lovecraft, creator of the famed Cthulu mythos, whose own fiction was greatly influenced by this book stated that The King in Yellow 'achieves notable heights of cosmic fear'.",Fiction  ,The King in Yellow

Wynne D.,"Victorian sensation novels, with their compulsive plots of crime, transgression and mystery, were bestsellers. Deborah Wynne analyses the fascinating relationships between sensation novels and the magazines in which they were serialized. Drawing upon the work of Wilkie Collins, Mary Braddon, Charles Dickens, Ellen Wood, and Charles Reade, and such popular family journals as All The Year Round, The Cornhill, and Once a Week , the author highlights how novels and magazines worked together to engage in the major cultural and social debates of the period.",Literary Criticism  ,The Sensation Novel and the Victorian Family Magazine
Blumberg Jane,"Mary Shelley's Early Novels seeks to redress the commonly held view that Mary Shelley was simply another mouthpiece for her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her most challenging and ambitious novels; Frankenstein, Valperga, and The Last Man, are examined in the light of her intellectual relationship with Percy Shelley. We see the way in which these novels reflect her gradual rejection of his radical tenets in an assertion of her own intellectual and ideological independence.",Fiction  ,Mary Shelley's Early Novels
Eliot George,"The Clarendon edition of Adam Bede (1859) is the first critical edition of the work that established George Eliot's reputation. Its extensive textual apparatus lists manuscript and first edition variants from the copy-text, which is the corrected eighth edition of 1861 - her last revision of the book. The introduction locates the genesis of the novel in Eliot's family history, her travels, and her reading of literature and biography, and describes the composition process, including her debate with the publisher John Blackwood about the suitability of the subject-matter for a family audience, as both author and publisher anticipated its appearing initially in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Using Blackwood's publication ledgers, it also establishes the details of the eleven complete or nearly complete resettings of the novel in Eliot's lifetime; and examines the author's revisions to a manuscript that is popularly, but erroneously, thought to have been little altered, giving detailed attention to the dialect in the context of more than 900 variants between manuscript and first edition.",Fiction  ,Adam Bede
Levine George,"How to Read the Victorian Novel provides a unique introduction to the genre. Using examples from the classics, like The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and Middlemarch, it demonstrates just how unfamiliar their familiarity is. The book attempts to break free of the sense that the Victorian novel is somehow old fashioned, moralizing, and formally careless by emphasizing the complexity, difficulty, and rare pleasures of the Victorian writers' strenuous efforts both to entertain and to teach; to create serious ""art"" and to appeal to wide audiences; to respond both to the demands of publishing and also to their own rich imaginative engagement with a world heading into modernity at full speed. Broad in its scope, the text surveys a wide variety of literary types and explores the cultural and historical developments of the novel form itself. The book also poses a series of ""big questions"" pertaining to money, capitalism, industry, race, gender, and, at the same time, to formal issues, such as plotting, perspective, and realist representation.In addition, it locates the qualities that give to the great variety of Victorian novels a ""family resemblance,"" the material conditions of their production, their tendency to multiply plots, their obsession with class and money, their problematic handling of gender questions, and their commitment to realist representation. How to Read the Victorian Novel challenges our comfortable expectations of the genre in order to explore intensively a burgeoning and changing literary form which mirrors a burgeoning and changing society.",Literary Criticism  ,How to Read the Victorian Novel
McWilliams John,"John McWilliams has written the first, much needed account of the ways the promise and threat of political revolution have informed masterpieces of the historical novel. The jolting sense of historical change caused by the French Revolution led to an immense readership for a new kind of fiction, centered on revolution, counter-revolution and warfare, which soon came to be called ""the historical novel."" During the turbulent wake of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, promptly followed by the phenomenon of Napoleon Bonaparte, the historical novel thus served as a literary hybrid in the most positive sense of that often-dismissive term. It enabled readers to project personal hopes and anxieties about revolutionary change back into national history. While immersed in the fictive lives of genteel, often privileged heroes, readers could measure their own political convictions against the wavering loyalties of their counterparts in a previous but still familiar time. McWilliams provides close readings of some twenty historical novels, from Scott and Cooper through Tolstoy, Zola and Hugo, to Pasternak and Lampedusa, and ultimately to Marquez and Hilary Mantel, but with continuing regard to historical contexts past and present. He traces the transformation of the literary conventions established by Scott's Waverley novels, showing both the continuities and the changes needed to meet contemporary times and perspectives. Although the progressive hopes imbedded in Scott's narrative form proved no longer adaptable to twentieth century carnage and the rise of totalitarianism, the meaning of any single novel emerges through comparison to the tradition of its predecessors. A foreword and epilogue explore the indebtedness of McWilliams's perspective to the Marxist scholarly tradition of Georg Lukacs and Frederic Jameson, while defining his differences from them. This is a scholarly work of no small ambition and achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,Revolution and the Historical Novel
Demirturk E. Lale,"This book examines the post-9/11 African American novels, developing a new critical discourse on everyday discursive practices of whiteness.

Young Arlene,"This book examines class and its representation in Victorian literature, focusing on the emergence of the lower middle class and middle-class responses to it. Arlene Young analyses portraits of white-collar workers, both men and women, who laboured under disparaging misperceptions of their values, abilities, and cultural significance, and shows how these misperceptions were both formulated and resisted. The analysis includes canonical texts like Dickens's Little Dorrit and Gissing's The Odd Women as well as less well-known works by Dinah Mulock Craik, Margaret Oliphant, Amy Levy, Grant Allen, H.G.

Martin George R. R.,"George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones is brought to life in the pages of this full-colour graphic novel. This is the third volume in what is sure to be one of the most coveted collaborations of the year. Now a major Sky Atlantic TV series from HBO, featuring a stellar cast. When dealing with a masterpiece, only the best will do. That's why writer Daniel Abraham and illustrator Tommy Patterson were chosen to adapt George R. R. Martin's beloved fantasy classic A Game of Thrones as a graphic novel. And as anyone who has read the previous two collected volumes of the ongoing series can attest, the result has been a stunning tour de force faithful in every respect to its brilliant original. In King's Landing, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell-the Hand of King Robert Baratheon-is surrounded by enemies. Some are openly declared, such as Ser Jaime Lannister and his sister, Queen Cersei. Others are hidden in the shadows. Still others wear the smiling mask of friends. But all are deadly, as Eddard is about to discover. Nor is the enmity between Eddard and the Lannister siblings the sole source of friction between these powerful noble families. For Tyrion Lannister, the Imp-whose stunted, twisted body houses the mind of a genius-has but lately won his freedom from Lady Catelyn Stark, Eddard's wife, who had accused him of attempting to murder her youngest son, Brandon. Now he seeks out his father, his restless thoughts bent on revenge. Far to the north, the bastard Jon Snow, newly sworn to the Night's Watch, takes the first faltering steps toward a destiny stranger than he could ever dream-a destiny that will bring him face-to-face with unspeakable horrors from beyond the edge of the world.

Vlock Deborah,"Dickens' novels, like those of his contemporaries, are more explicitly indebted to the theatre than scholars have supposed: his stories and characters were often already public property by the time they were published, circulating as part of a current theatrical repertoire well known to many Victorian readers. In this 1998 study, Deborah Vlock argues that novels - and novel-readers - were in effect created by the popular theatre in the nineteenth century, and that the possibility of reading and writing narrative was conditioned by the culture of the stage. Vlock resuscitates the long-dead voices of Dickens' theatrical sources, which now only tentatively inhabit reviews, scripts, fiction and non-fiction narratives, but which were everywhere in Dickens' time: voices of noted actors and actresses and of popular theatrical characters. She uncovers unexpected precursors for some popular Dickensian characters, and reconstructs the conditions in which Dickens' novels were initially received.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture: Dickens, Novel Reading, and the Victorian Popular Theatre Series Number 19"

Dames Nicholas,"How did the Victorians read novels? Nicholas Dames answers that deceptively simple question by revealing a now-forgotten range of nineteenth-century theories of the novel, a range based in a study of human physiology during the act of reading, He demonstrates the ways in which the Victorians thought they read, and uncovers surprising responses to the question of what might have transpired in the minds and bodies of readers of Victorian fiction. His detailed studiesof novel critics who were also interested in neurological science, combined with readings of novels by Thackeray, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing, propose a vision of the Victorian novel-reader as far from the quietly immersed being we now imagine - as instead a reader whose nervous system wasaddressed, attacked, and soothed by authors newly aware of the neural operations of their public. Rich in unexpected intersections, from the British response to Wagnerian opera to the birth of speed-reading in the late nineteenth century, The Physiology of the Novel challenges our assumptions about what novel-reading once did, and still does, to the individual reader, and provides new answers to the question of how novels influenced a culture's way of reading, responding, and feeling.",Fiction  ,The Physiology of the Novel

Hutchby Marc,"In this thesis, the author investigates the chemistry and application of molecules containing urea and amide bonds. These bonds are some of the strongest known and are fundamental to biological processes. The author describes his discovery that sterically hindered ureas undergo solvolysis at room temperature under neutral conditions. This is a remarkable finding, since ureas are inert under these conditions and a general rule of chemistry is that hindered substrates are less reactive. Remarkably, the author translates these results to the correspondingly sterically hindered amides. This thesis has resulted in a number of outstanding publications in high profile journals. The unique method for breaking urea and amide bonds developed in this study is likely to have far reaching consequences for biological protein manipulation.",Science  ,Novel Synthetic Chemistry of Ureas and Amides
