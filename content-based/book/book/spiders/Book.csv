Anne Frank was sent to the Bergen-Belsen camp where she died of typhus, a mere two weeks before the camp was liberated by British troops. She was fifteen-years-old.

Art Spiegelman,"The Complete Maus is a graphic novel collecting Art Spiegelman's Maus, A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History as well as And Here My Troubles Begin.Summary of the BookThere are few representations of the Nazi regime which ring with as much truth as Maus. Picture the Nazis as cats, the Jews as mice and the Poles as pigs. Art Spiegelman’s vision of his father’s struggles under the Nazi regime is an apt metaphor which reveals the truly ghastly scenario under the Third Reich. Spiegelman visits his father Vladek who is now married to a woman called Mala in the time since the suicide of Spiegelman’s mother. He informs Vladek that he wants to tell the story of his escape from the Holocaust and his life in Czestochowa. Vladek brushes the effort off in his characteristic style but nevertheless begins telling a story rooted in the mid-1930s. He was a young man who came to marry into a wealthy family. Through his father-in-law’s resources, he moves to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. Following the birth of their first son, Richieu, Vladek’s wife Anja breaks down due to postpartum depression. They go to a sanatorium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. By the time they return home, political and anti-Semitic tensions have already begun to take roots in the country. Vladek is soon drafted just before the invasion. He is soon captured at the front lines and forced into labour as a prisoner of war. The narrative that follows showcases the atrocities of the Nazis and reveals the conditions within the Ghettos. Vladek’s stereotypical nature and Spiegelman’s own reactions to his father’s approaching weakness tell a tale of a son trying to understand a father and the nightmares that he has faced.About Art SpiegelmanItzhak Avraham ben Zeev, better known as Art Spiegelman, is an American cartoonist, editor and comics advocate. He has also worked on The Wild Party, Open Me, I'm A Dog, Jack Cole and Plastic Man, In the Shadow of No Towers and Breakdowns.Spiegelman has won several awards for his work on Maus, including an Eisner Award, a Harvey Award and a Pulitzer Prize.

Rajiv Malhotra,"India is more than a nation state. It is also a unique civilization with philosophies and cosmologies that are markedly distinct from the dominant culture of our times — the West. India's spiritual traditions spring from dharma which has no exact equivalent in Western frameworks. Unfortunately, in the rush to celebrate the growing popularity of India on the world stage, its civilizational matrix is being co-opted into Western universalism, thereby diluting its distinctiveness and potential.In Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism, thinker and philosopher Rajiv Malhotra addresses the challenge of a direct and honest engagement on differences, by reversing the gaze, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer and looking at the West from the dharmic point of view. In doing so, he challenges many hitherto unexamined beliefs that both sides hold about themselves and each other. He highlights that while unique historical revelations are the basis for Western religions, dharma emphasizes self-realization in the body here and now. He also points out the integral unity that underpins dharma's metaphysics and contrasts this with Western thought and history as a synthetic unity.Erudite and engaging, Being Different critiques fashionable reductive translations and analyses the West's anxiety over difference and fixation for order which contrast the creative role of chaos in dharma. It concludes with a rebuttal of Western claims of universalism, while recommending a multi-civilizational worldview.About the AuthorRajiv Malhotra is an Indian-American researcher and public intellectual on current affairs, worlds religions, cross-cultural encounters and science. A scientist by training, he was previously a senior corporate executive, strategic consultant and entrepreneur in information technology and media.

Lalitha Raghupathi,"Kannagi, a gem of a housewife, a 'paragon of chastity' has been immortalised in the pages of Silappadikaaram, the famous Tamil epic of Ilango, the Chera prince-turned-ascetic.

An ill-fated housewife, Kannagi loses her husband Kovalan, to the art of a dancer, Madhavi, and finds him again to lose him to the blind law of a king. Her story is set in the three ancient cities of South India - Poompuhar, the Chola capital where she grew up, Madurai, the Pandya capital where she fell; and Vanji, the Chera capital which placed her on a pedestal. The epic is a rich record of a great civilization, vivid with descriptions of edifices, shrines, docks, market places and squares, of laws and rituals, Natya Shastra (science of dance), musicology and musical instruments of the day. Known for its high dramatic content, Silappadikaaram is a shining jewel in Tamil literature.

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Anderson Jon Lee,"Che Guevara's legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of 39, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally famed icon, as revered as he is controversial. A Marxist ideologue, he sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare - and has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of change. In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and Jose Hernandez reveal the man behind the myth, creating a complex portrait of this passionate idealist. Adapted from Anderson's masterwork, Che transports us from young Ernesto's medical school days to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution; from his place of power alongside Castro to his disastrous sojourn in the Congo, and his violent end in Bolivia. Through renowned Mexican artist Jose Hernandez's drawings, we feel the bullets fly past in Cuba; smell the smoke of Castro's cigars; and scrutinize the face of the weary guerrilla as he is called 'Comandante' for the first time. With astonishing precision, colour, and drama, Che makes us first-hand witnesses to the revolutionary life and times of this historic figure. Combining Anderson's unprecedented access and research with Hernandez's emotionally gripping artwork, Che resurrects the man for a new generation of readers.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,"Che Guevara,  (English, Hardcover, Anderson Jon Lee)"

Terry Pratchett,"The Colour of Magic begins Terry Pratchett’s Discworld comic fantasy series, which are set on a flat world shouldered on the top of four elephants resting on a stellar turtle.Summary of the BookThere are an infinite number of things out there in that final frontier called space. There are comets whizzing past, asteroids lost cluelessly, invisible black holes which suck light itself into their loins and a turtle called the Great A'tuin, larger than a planet, silently sailing through the abyss, possibly contemplating breakfast. Atop this turtle stand four elephants, as large as moons. On their shoulders rests a flat world called the Discworld. This world is populated by people of every colour, race and magical orientation possible. It has certain laws, which even though they spit in the face of physics, astronomy and evolutionary biology, are quite inflexible. One of them dictates that when a Wizard is about to die, he will be escorted by Death. The Reaper speaks without vocal cords, in a “voice” like the slamming of coffin lids, needing small caps to say what he needs to. (DO NOT TAKE ME LIGHTLY HUMAN, I WILL COME FOR YOU NEXT. HURRY UP, I’M NEVER LATE. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE GOING TO BE). There are four main continents on this odd planet, and this story occurs on the Unnamed Continent, where the regularly chaotic life of heroes, Wizards and thieves is upset by the arrival of a strangely clad man. He bears a large trunk with several legs called Luggage which has a mind of his own, and in it, he has a lot of gold. He is Twoflower, an odd little man and the Discworld’s first tourist. He quickly hires the failed wizard Rincewind to show him around. However, he might yet regret his choice, for Rincewind was cast out of the greatest institute for magic in the universe: the Unseen Academy. His crime was oddly unique, for he looked into a forbidden book containing a dangerous spell. The spell occupied his entire mind, preventing him from learning any other spells. The spell is so dangerous that all wizards fear it. In fact, it’s so dangerous that no one remembers what it really does!About Terry PratchettSir Terence David John “Terry” Pratchett is a British novelist known for his Discworld series of novels.

Vanessa R. Sasson,"Who was Yasodhara? The Buddha's forgotten and abandoned wife? The mother of his only son? Or an enlightened being in her own right, denied her rightful place in the stories and histories about the Buddha? A long time ago, in a far-off kingdom, a boy and a girl, born on the same day, were destined to be together-and then painfully wrenched apart. The boy was Siddhattha, heir to the Sakya kingdom and the future Buddha; the girl was the beautiful and precocious Yasodhara, his friend who became his loving wife. In this exquisitely crafted narrative, we encounter Yasodhara as a fiercely independent, passionate and resilient individual. We witness her joys and sorrows, her expectations and frustrations, her fairy-tale wedding, and her overwhelming devastation at the departure of her beloved. It is through her eyes that we witness Siddhattha's slow transformation, from a sheltered prince to a deeply sensitive young man. On the way, we see how the gods watch over the future Buddha from the clouds, how the king and his ministers try to keep the suffering of the world from him and how he eventually renounces the throne, his wife and newly-born son to seek enlightenment. Resurrecting a forgotten woman from the origin stories of the Buddha, Vanessa R. Sasson combines the spirit of fiction and the fabulism of Indian mythology with impeccable scholarship, to tell the evocative and deeply moving story of an extraordinary life.About the Author Vanessa R.

Rowson Martin,"In Martin Rowson's ""The Waste Land"", private detective Chris Marlowe is tasked with getting to the bottom of the most impenetrable of all modernist mysteries: namely T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"". Cunningly contrived, this irreverent graphic parody is inspired in equal parts by the classic modernist poem and by the American noir novels of Raymond Chandler. Marlowe, searching for his dead partner's killers, is lured into a web of murder, deceit, lust, despair, and, of course, a frantic quest for the Holy Grail. Doped, duped, pistol-whipped, framed by the cops, and going nowhere fast, Marlowe enters a nightmare world where Robert Frost, Norman Mailer, and Edmund Wilson drink in the gloom of a London pub; where Auden is glimpsed entering the men's room; where Henry James, Aldous Huxley, and Richard Wagner share an ice cream aboard a Thames pleasure steamer; and where, out of luck and out of clues, Marlowe finally tracks down T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Available again for the first time in a decade, this is an unforgettably strange trip through modern literature with one of Britain's best writers and illustrators.",Travel  ,"The Waste Land,  (English, Paperback, Rowson Martin)"

Thomas Chris D.,"THE TIMES, ECONOMIST AND GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2017 It is accepted wisdom today that human beings have irrevocably damaged the natural world. Yet what if this narrative obscures a more hopeful truth? In Inheritors of the Earth, renowned ecologist and environmentalist Chris D. Thomas overturns the accepted story, revealing how nature is fighting back. Many animals and plants actually benefit from our presence, raising biological diversity in most parts of the world and increasing the rate at which new species are formed, perhaps to the highest level in Earth's history. From Costa Rican tropical forests to the thoroughly transformed British landscape, nature is coping surprisingly well in the human epoch. Chris Thomas takes us on a gripping round-the-world journey to meet the enterprising creatures that are thriving in the Anthropocene, from York's ochre-coloured comma butterfly to hybrid bison in North America, scarlet-beaked pukekos in New Zealand, and Asian palms forming thickets in the European Alps. In so doing, he questions our irrational persecution of so-called 'invasive species', and shows us that we should not treat the Earth as a faded masterpiece that we need to restore. After all, if life can recover from the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, might it not be able to survive the onslaughts of a technological ape? Combining a naturalist's eye for wildlife with an ecologist's wide lens, Chris Thomas forces us to re-examine humanity's relationship with nature, and reminds us that the story of life is the story of change.",Science  ,"Inheritors of the Earth,  (English, Hardcover, Thomas Chris D.)"

Vikram Kapur,"To Deepa, Prem gave no hint of the churning inside him. In front of her he affected a cheery demeanour, indulging her in her plans for their honeymoon, which she kept revising. It was a welcome escape from the mayhem surrounding him. There were occasions where the pretence got to him and a voice rose inside, urging him to tell her everything. He silenced it. Deepa was a Hindu and would never understand. Until then, he had never thought of her as different. Prem Kohli, the handsome, ambitious son of a Sikh refugee, has the world at his feet. A glittering career lies ahead, and he has just got engaged to his college girlfriend, Deepa, overcoming her parents' reservations about Hindus and Sikhs intermarrying.

Fraught with difficulties and a surprising villain, the story is packed with action.Summary Of The BookTintin Explorers On The Moon, as the name suggests, sees Tintin have an adventure on the moon itself. A continuation of Destination Moon, Tintin, Snowy, Professor Calculus and his assistant Frank Wolff, along with Captain Haddock and Thomson and Thompson, head to the moon on an expedition.The mission is jinxed right from the start with many accidents and obstacles to overcome, the primary one being the presence of two additional members when the rocket has only enough oxygen for four instead of six. Unexpected disasters like Haddock unintentionally engaging in a spacewalk, landing difficulties and Thomson and Thompson sprouting hair that changes color are seen at the beginning of the mission. After the crew lands on the moon, they explore the area in detail. A sudden discovery of an unexpected spy among the gang turns up the tension. A dastardly villain appears and chaos soon ensues. The climax sees Tintin and the villain in a fight to the death. An unexpected casualty and a brave act of remorse is shown as the crew returns to earth.Tintin Explorers On The Moon was written and released a decade before the historic flight of Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969.

Even the checkered design bears a resemblance. Many other such scientific accuracies like water on the moon and inaccuracies like the crew being upside down can be inferred on further analysis. Nevertheless, Tintin Explorers On The Moon features innovative ideas and art in depicting a storyline far from its present realities.About HergeHergé was the pen name of Georges Prosper Remi, a Belgian artist widely known for his work on The Adventures of Tintin. His other works include Quick &amp; Flupke, The Adventures of Tom and Millie, Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Piglet and Jo, Zette and Jocko. He popularised the ligne claire style of art which portrays lines in a uniform fashion contrasted by use of bold colors and realistic backgrounds.

Toni Patel,"India in the mid-19th century was under the rule of the British East India Company. The Company's army was largely Indian, commanded by British officers who were often authoritarian and ill informed about local culture. There was significant resentment in local population against foreign rule that surfaced every now and then. The annexation of Oudh in violation of an existing treaty had alienated the company soldiers. In this charged environment, the last straw came in the form of rumors that the new cartridges issued to the army were laced with pig and cow fat. Soldiers needed to tear these cartridges with their teeth before loading rifles. Since the Hindus revered the cow and Muslims considered pigs unclean the news inflamed soldiers of both communities. An open rebellion followed. The first shots were fired by Mangal Pande, a quiet man of the lower ranks. His action started a revolt that grew into an India-wide uprising. Though it did not end colonial rule, it ended the rule of the East India Company. Indians in later years remembered the events of 1857 as the 'First War of Independence' and Mangal Pande, its acclaimed hero.","9788184821956, 8184821956  ","Mangal Pande,  (English, Paperback, Toni Patel)"

The text holds out infinite possibilities for the intending readers set out to undertake a serious study.The Cat and Shakespeare (1965), Comrade Kirillov (1976) are intact with the solidity of an inbuilt structural irony and put up an amazing picture, in an amusing manner, of the piquant situation obtaining all over India in the post-Independence period, soon after the euphoria of Independence struggle ceased to exercise its influence.The study being selective, is confined to socio-cultural aspects of life as reflected in the above texts.About Author:Dr. A.S.

Goscinny Rene,"The first ever volume of the famed Asterix comic book series, it is certainly the nostalgic starting point for all Asterix fans.Summary Of The BookThe story begins, as all of Asterix’s adventures do, by invoking the state of Gaul at the time – occupied by the Romans, though not entirely. The one small village of indomitable Gauls still holding out against the invaders is slowly zoomed into. In this first ever adventure, the Romans, led by Centurion Crismus Bonus attempt to figure out what gave the Gauls their superhuman strength. They find that the secret lies in a potion brewed by their fearsome (yet rather fatherly) druid, Getafix. This leads them to their first ever attempt to capture the venerable druid, which they manage to do without a snag, at least initially.The druid is captured and tortured until the torturer is utterly exhausted and stunned by the resistance of Getafix to his methods. Instead, they capture Asterix, who had caught wind of the Romans’ scheme and snuck into their camp, and try to torture him instead, which works brilliantly – so brilliantly that the torturer hardly had to tie him down before the Gaulish warrior began to beg for mercy. This forces Getafix to comply with the Romans’ demand to brew his secret potion for them and goes on to give them an elaborate list of ingredients. But what exactly will the druid concoct? Will it be his famous magic potion or do Asterix and Getafix have other tricks up their sleeves?Asterix The Gaul was named the twenty third most influential book of the twentieth century by the magazine Le Monde.

Cline Ernest,"FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF READY PLAYER ONE, NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG'[A] masterful tale of Earth's desperate struggle against a powerful alien foe.' - Andy Weir, bestselling author of The Martian**************************************************************It's just another day of high school for Zack Lightman. He's daydreaming through another boring math class, with just one more month to go until graduation and freedom-if he can make it that long without getting suspended again. Then he glances out his classroom window and spots the flying saucer. At first, Zack thinks he's going crazy.A minute later, he's sure of it. Because the UFO he's staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called Armada-in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. But what Zack's seeing is all too real. And his skills-as well as those of millions of gamers across the world-are going to be needed to save the earth from what's about to befall it. Yet even as he and his new comrades scramble to prepare for the alien onslaught, Zack can't help thinking of all the science-fiction books, TV shows, and movies he grew up reading and watching, and wonder: Doesn't something about this scenario seem a little too... familiar?

Chaturvedi A. K.,"Although rural life has been dealt with in a number of Indian English novels, tribals as such have rarely been depicted in them. This fact testifies to the conspiracy of silence against a large chunk of society that is doomed to remain marginalized and lead life in its periphery. The reasons for this silence are not far to seek in view of the urban and westernized background of Indian English writers and their preoccupation with urban life and its problems. However, the references to tribal life are sporadically mentioned in Arun Joshi’s The Strange Case of Billy Biswas, Kamala Markandaya’s The Coffer Dam, Manohar Malgaonkar’s The Princes, Gita Mehta’s A River Sutra and Kiran Desai’s The Inheritance of Loss. This book is a humble attempt to highlight these references.The book seeks to bring out the similarity between the primitive life as portrayed by the Indian English novelists and as lived by the tribals in the remote rural areas of India. It also brings to light the tribal beliefs and practices, customs and traditions, rites and rituals, feasts and festivals, apparel and adornment, songs and dance as presented in Indian English novel.It is hoped that the students, researchers and even teachers of Indian English literature will find this book interesting and a valuable reference source.About the AuthorA.K. Chaturvedi obtained his Master’s Degree and Ph.D. in English Literature from Agra University. He worked as a lecturer in English in Ganj Dundwara P.G. College, Etah (U.P.) during 1988 89.

Levine George,"How to Read the Victorian Novel provides a unique introduction to the genre. Using examples from the classics, like The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and Middlemarch, it demonstrates just how unfamiliar their familiarity is. The book attempts to break free of the sense that the Victorian novel is somehow old fashioned, moralizing, and formally careless by emphasizing the complexity, difficulty, and rare pleasures of the Victorian writers' strenuous efforts both to entertain and to teach; to create serious ""art"" and to appeal to wide audiences; to respond both to the demands of publishing and also to their own rich imaginative engagement with a world heading into modernity at full speed. Broad in its scope, the text surveys a wide variety of literary types and explores the cultural and historical developments of the novel form itself. The book also poses a series of ""big questions"" pertaining to money, capitalism, industry, race, gender, and, at the same time, to formal issues, such as plotting, perspective, and realist representation.In addition, it locates the qualities that give to the great variety of Victorian novels a ""family resemblance,"" the material conditions of their production, their tendency to multiply plots, their obsession with class and money, their problematic handling of gender questions, and their commitment to realist representation. How to Read the Victorian Novel challenges our comfortable expectations of the genre in order to explore intensively a burgeoning and changing literary form which mirrors a burgeoning and changing society.",Literary Criticism  ,"How to Read the Victorian Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Levine George)"
McWilliams John,"John McWilliams has written the first, much needed account of the ways the promise and threat of political revolution have informed masterpieces of the historical novel. The jolting sense of historical change caused by the French Revolution led to an immense readership for a new kind of fiction, centered on revolution, counter-revolution and warfare, which soon came to be called ""the historical novel."" During the turbulent wake of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, promptly followed by the phenomenon of Napoleon Bonaparte, the historical novel thus served as a literary hybrid in the most positive sense of that often-dismissive term. It enabled readers to project personal hopes and anxieties about revolutionary change back into national history. While immersed in the fictive lives of genteel, often privileged heroes, readers could measure their own political convictions against the wavering loyalties of their counterparts in a previous but still familiar time. McWilliams provides close readings of some twenty historical novels, from Scott and Cooper through Tolstoy, Zola and Hugo, to Pasternak and Lampedusa, and ultimately to Marquez and Hilary Mantel, but with continuing regard to historical contexts past and present. He traces the transformation of the literary conventions established by Scott's Waverley novels, showing both the continuities and the changes needed to meet contemporary times and perspectives. Although the progressive hopes imbedded in Scott's narrative form proved no longer adaptable to twentieth century carnage and the rise of totalitarianism, the meaning of any single novel emerges through comparison to the tradition of its predecessors. A foreword and epilogue explore the indebtedness of McWilliams's perspective to the Marxist scholarly tradition of Georg Lukacs and Frederic Jameson, while defining his differences from them. This is a scholarly work of no small ambition and achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,"Revolution and the Historical Novel,  (English, Hardcover, McWilliams John)"

This book is the first to suggest that the fierce debates over patent law and the discussion of invention and inventors in popular texts during the nineteenth century informedthe parallel debate over the professional status of authors. The book examines the shared rhetoric surrounding the creation of the 'inventor' and the 'author' in the debate of the 1830s, and the challenge of the emerging technologies of mass production to traditional ideas of art and industry isaddressed in a chapter on authorship at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Subsequent chapters show how novelists Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot participated in debates over the value and ownership of labour in the 1850s, such as patent reform and the controversy over married women's property. The book shows the ways in which these were reflected in their novels. It also suggests that the publication of those novels, and the celebrity of their authors, had a substantial effecton the subsequent direction of these debates. The final chapter shows that Thomas Hardy's later fiction reflects an important shift in thinking about creativity and ownership towards the end of the century. Patent Inventions argues that Victorian writers used the novel not just to reflect, but alsoto challenge received notions of intellectual ownership and responsibility. It ends by suggesting that detailed study of the debate over intellectual property in the nineteenth century leads to a better understanding of the complex negotiations over the bounds of selfhood and social responsibility in the period.",Literary Criticism  ,"Patent Inventions - Intellectual Property and the Victorian Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Pettitt Clare)"

Ingulsrud John E.,"Japanese animation, video games, and manga have attracted fans around the world. The characters, the stories, and the sensibilities that come out of these cultural products are together called Japan Cool. This is not a sudden fad, but is rooted in manga-Japanese comics-which since the mid-1940s have developed in an exponential way. In spite of a gradual decline in readership, manga still commands over a third of the publishing output. The volume of manga works that is being produced and has been through history is enormous. There are manga publications that attract readers of all ages and genders. The diversity in content attracts readers well into adulthood. Surveys on reading practices have found that almost all Japanese people read manga or have done so at some point in their lives. The skills of reading manga are learned by readers themselves, but learned in the context of other readers and in tandem with school learning. Manga reading practices are sustained by the practices of other readers, and manga content therefore serves as a topic of conversation for both families and friends. Moreover, manga is one of the largest sources of content for media production in film, television, and video games. Manga literacy, the practices of the readers, the diversity of titles, and the sheer number of works provide the basis for the movement recognized as Japan Cool. Reading Japan Cool is directed at an audience of students of Japanese studies, discourse analysts, educators, parents, and manga readers.",Social Science  ,"Reading Japan Cool,  (English, Hardcover, Ingulsrud John E.)"
Dames Nicholas,"How did the Victorians read novels? Nicholas Dames answers that deceptively simple question by revealing a now-forgotten range of nineteenth-century theories of the novel, a range based in a study of human physiology during the act of reading, He demonstrates the ways in which the Victorians thought they read, and uncovers surprising responses to the question of what might have transpired in the minds and bodies of readers of Victorian fiction. His detailed studiesof novel critics who were also interested in neurological science, combined with readings of novels by Thackeray, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing, propose a vision of the Victorian novel-reader as far from the quietly immersed being we now imagine - as instead a reader whose nervous system wasaddressed, attacked, and soothed by authors newly aware of the neural operations of their public. Rich in unexpected intersections, from the British response to Wagnerian opera to the birth of speed-reading in the late nineteenth century, The Physiology of the Novel challenges our assumptions about what novel-reading once did, and still does, to the individual reader, and provides new answers to the question of how novels influenced a culture's way of reading, responding, and feeling.",Fiction  ,"The Physiology of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Dames Nicholas)"

Rice,"In this engaging study, H. William Rice illuminates the mystery that is Ralph Ellison: the author of one complex, important novel who failed to complete his second; a black intellectual who remained notably reticent on political issues during the desegregation of his native South. Rice reads both Invisible Man and the posthumously published Juneteenth as novels that focus on the political uses of language. He explores Ellison's concept of the novel, promulgated in that author's two collections of essays, as an inherently political form of art. And he carefully considers the political context that undoubtedly impacted Ellison's work and thought: a world and a time rocked to its foundation by such revolutionary actors as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. Rice guides his reader to a greater understanding of Ralph Ellison, his oeuvre, and the American novel.",Literary Criticism  ,"Ralph Ellison and the Politics of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Rice)"

Hutchby Marc,"In this thesis, the author investigates the chemistry and application of molecules containing urea and amide bonds. These bonds are some of the strongest known and are fundamental to biological processes. The author describes his discovery that sterically hindered ureas undergo solvolysis at room temperature under neutral conditions. This is a remarkable finding, since ureas are inert under these conditions and a general rule of chemistry is that hindered substrates are less reactive. Remarkably, the author translates these results to the correspondingly sterically hindered amides. This thesis has resulted in a number of outstanding publications in high profile journals. The unique method for breaking urea and amide bonds developed in this study is likely to have far reaching consequences for biological protein manipulation.",Science  ,"Novel Synthetic Chemistry of Ureas and Amides,  (English, Paperback, Hutchby Marc)"

Mizuhara Tsukasa,"The author successfully developed novel anti-HIV PD 404182 derivatives that exhibited submicromolar inhibitory activity against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. His thesis is in three parts. The first part expounds efficient methods for the synthesis of tricyclic heterocycles related to PD 404182 based on the sp2-carbon heteroatom bond formations. Starting from arene or haloarene, C-O, C-N, or C-S bonds were formed by simply changing the reactants. These synthetic methods provide powerful approaches for the divergent preparation of pyrimido-benzoxazine, -quinazoline, or -benzothiazine derivatives. The second part explains SAR studies of PD 404182 for the development of anti-HIV agents. Through optimization studies of the central 1,3-thiazin-2-imine core, the benzene and cyclic amidine ring parts, 3-fold more potent inhibitors were obtained compared with the lead compound. The author also reveals by a time-of-drug-addition experiment that PD 404182 derivatives impaired HIV replication at the binding or fusion stage. The third part of the thesis elucidates the development of photoaffinity probes for the target identification of PD 404182. By the photolabeling experiment of HIV-1-infected H9 cells using these probes, the author detected proteins specifically bound to PD 404182. These new anti-HIV agents may be promising agents for anti-HIV therapy because their mechanisms of action differ from those of the currently approved anti-HIV agents.",Science  ,"Development of Novel Anti-HIV Pyrimidobenzothiazine Derivatives,  (English, Hardcover, Mizuhara Tsukasa)"

Shah Manzoor Ahmad,"The book provides basic knowledge in mycorrhizal ecology, knitted with novel conceptual frameworks and contemporary perspectives, especially in the context of global change. In a fast changing world wherein anthropogenic climate change, biological invasions, deforestation, desertification, and frequent droughts have become routine hard realities, the contents of this book urge readers to rethink basic notions of setting and accomplishing objectives in mycorrhizal research to make sense vis-a-vis contemporary challenges. In this book, a global perspective of mycorrhizal diversity and distribution is provided, followed by some insights into the impact of various global change elements such as climate change, plant invasion, and extreme environmental conditions on mycorrhizas and the role of these mutualists in turn to help their host plants to withstand such novel selection pressures. Special attention here is given to the interesting, but largely neglected, topics such as the role of mycorrhizas in ecological restoration of degraded environments and mycorrhizal status of aquatic plants. The basic idea is to unify various topical areas in mycorrhizal science in an integrated framework. This book can be used by the undergraduate and graduate level students studying mycorrhizal symbioses in the context of current ecological applications. The materials in this book will benefit biological scientists actively involved in research on mycorrhizal ecology and global environmental change.

Wilson Diana de Armas,"Two sets of related issues prompt this study: the birth of the New World in European consciousness and the rise of the Cervantine novel in Spain. The conquest, exploration, and colonization of the Indies resonate through Cervantes's two novels, Don Quixote (1605, 1615) and the Persiles (1617), both fortified by imperialism. Cervantes begins publishing in the 1580s, just as the might of imperial Spain turned from Europe towards the Atlantic. Twicerefused emigration papers to America - which he depicts as the 'refuge and haven of all the desperate men of Spain' - Cervantes turns to fiction. His novels internalize many colonial discourses and at least four genres implicated in Spain's New World enterprise: the Books of Chivalry, the utopias, the colonial war epic,and American ethnohistory.

van de Hey Joshua,"In this thesis, a new lidar (light detection and ranging) ceilometer capable of monitoring cloud base and sensitive to boundary layer aerosols is introduced. The key to this novelty lies in its divided-lens design that addresses a classical lidar problem of balancing transmitter-receiver overlap and signal-to-noise ratio, along with a method for characterizing overlap in the laboratory. Enhanced sensitivity in the near-range of the instrument is achieved without compromising signal-to-noise in a design that is straightforward to manufacture for broad deployment. The instrument, its optical characterization, and its performance in the field are described. The prototype instrument described here has since formed the basis of a commercial sensor for monitoring clouds and aerosols. High-resolution, continuous observations of clouds and aerosols are needed to reduce the large uncertainties in our current understanding of their influence on climate that have been highlighted by the International Panel on Climate Change. And as international health organizations indicate growing public health threats over the coming decades resulting from poor air quality, extensive aerosol monitoring is required to assess personal exposure to and the health impacts of anthropogenic particulates. Ground-based optical remote sensing measurements made by well-characterized instruments, such as that described in these pages, are critical to this.",Technology & Engineering  ,"A Novel Lidar Ceilometer,  (English, Hardcover, van de Hey Joshua)"

Dellino Clive V. J.,"The first edition of Cold and Chilled Storage Technology was prepared at a time when great changes were taking place in the industry that were hard to put into clear perspective. For example, the CFClozone layer problem was identified, the Montreal Protocol was signed and experts from many disci- plines were already proposing 'solutions' to the problems seen at the time. Not only were there the usual differences in approach to the problems, there were different understandings of the problems themselves. For in- stance, some authoritative voices were saying HCFC 22 was 'part of the solution, not part of the problem' and recommending it as the main refrig- erant for the future, others said the opposite. As editor, I have taken the view that this should be a 'reference book' and, as such, it should contain information that points in the direction of tried and proven good practice. To avoid the risk of misdirecting readers, I decided that the CFC issue was too unclear to be usefully discussed in the first edition and left it out altogether. This was the main criticism of the first edition at the time of its publication but, in view of the developments since then, I stand by my decision to avoid premature comment in that instance. The matter is discussed in this edition in Chapters 4 and 7, which include summaries of other related factors, in a way that was certainly not possible in 1989.",Technology & Engineering  ,"Cold and Chilled Storage Technology,  (English, Paperback, Dellino Clive V.

MISRA Pravati,"The book aims at an evaluation of the novels of Kamala Markandaya in the perspective of class-consciousness embedded in her fictional narrative. The study attempts to explore the impact of class-consciousness on the attitudes, manners and conditions of living in the context of modern India as it moves from a conservative and traditional social order to a liberal and urbanised socio-economic and cultural ethos. It seeks to explore Markandaya’s concern with the predicament of the individual in a class-ridden society subjected to a process of radical change. An attempt has been made to substantiate the hypothesis that in the process of this change, the self confronts tensions, uncertainties and conflicts that lead to deep psychological and spiritual wounds. The self, with its desires, instincts and dreams, encounters a world of reality governed by social, economic and cultural forces. This encounter leads to a crisis of identity. The self tries to surmount this crisis through resistance or reconciliation, through protest or surrender. In this process of self’s grappling with reality, there is anguish and suffering. This study, in short, is an attempt to exploring the paradox of human condition in terms of conflict between self and society, between free will and necessity.About the AuthorDr. Pravati Misra holds M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from the Utkal University, Orissa.

Arthur Golden,"In ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. Sayuri's story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion -- the geisha district of Kyoto -- with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a book of nuance and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos. And though the story is rich with detail and a vast knowledge of history, it is the transparent, seductive voice of Sayuri that the reader remembers.",Fiction  ,"Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel,  (English, Paperback, Arthur Golden)"

Joe Sacco,"'The blessing of an inherently interpretive medium like comics is that it hasn't allowed me to . . . make a virtue of dispassion. For good or for ill, the comics medium is adamant, and it has forced me to make choices. In my view, that is part of its message' - from the preface by Joe Sacco Over the past decade, Joe Sacco has increasingly turned to short-form com-ics journalism to report from conflict zones around the world. Collected here for the first time, Sacco's darkly funny, revealing reportage confirms his standing as one of the foremost international correspondents working today. Journalism takes readers from the smuggling tunnels of Gaza to war crimes trials in The Hague, from the lives of India's 'untouchables' to the ordeal of sub-Saharan refugees washed up on the shores of Malta. Sacco also confronts the misery and absurdity of the war in Iraq, including the darkest chapter in recent American history - the torture of detainees. Vividly depicting Sacco's own interactions with the people he meets, the stories in this remarkable collection argue for the essential truth in comics reportage, an inevitably subjective journalistic endeavour. Among Sacco's most mature and accomplished work, Journalism demonstrates the power of a great comics artist to chronicle lived experience with a force that often eludes other media.","9780224097321, 0224097326  ","Journalism,  (English, Hardcover, Joe Sacco)"

We see the way in which these novels reflect her gradual rejection of his radical tenets in an assertion of her own intellectual and ideological independence.",Fiction  ,"Mary Shelley's Early Novels,  (English, Paperback, Blumberg Jane)"
Eliot George,"The Clarendon edition of Adam Bede (1859) is the first critical edition of the work that established George Eliot's reputation. Its extensive textual apparatus lists manuscript and first edition variants from the copy-text, which is the corrected eighth edition of 1861 - her last revision of the book. The introduction locates the genesis of the novel in Eliot's family history, her travels, and her reading of literature and biography, and describes the composition process, including her debate with the publisher John Blackwood about the suitability of the subject-matter for a family audience, as both author and publisher anticipated its appearing initially in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Using Blackwood's publication ledgers, it also establishes the details of the eleven complete or nearly complete resettings of the novel in Eliot's lifetime; and examines the author's revisions to a manuscript that is popularly, but erroneously, thought to have been little altered, giving detailed attention to the dialect in the context of more than 900 variants between manuscript and first edition.",Fiction  ,"Adam Bede,  (English, Hardcover, Eliot George)"

Samios Jannis,"The unique behavior of the ""liquid state"", together with the richness of phenomena that are observed, render liquids particularly interesting for the scientific community. Note that the most important reactions in chemical and biological systems take place in solutions and liquid-like environments. Additionally, liquids are utilized for numerous industrial applications. It is for these reasons that the understanding of their properties at the molecular level is of foremost interest in many fields of science and engineering. What can be said with certainty is that both the experimental and theoretical studies of the liquid state have a long and rich history, so that one might suppose this to be essentially a solved problem. It should be emphasized, however, that although, for more than a century, the overall scientific effort has led to a considerable progress, our understanding of the properties of the liquid systems is still incomplete and there is still more to be explored. Basic reason for this is the ""many body"" character of the particle interactions in liquids and the lack of long-range order, which introduce in liquid state theory and existing simulation techniques a number of conceptual and technical problems that require specific approaches. Also, many of the elementary processes that take place in liquids, including molecular translational, rotational and vibrational motions (Trans. -Rot. -Vib. coupling), structural relaxation, energy dissipation and especially chemical changes in reactive systems occur at different and/or extremely short timescales.",Science  ,"Novel Approaches to the Structure and Dynamics of Liquids: Experiments, Theories and Simulations,  (English, Paperback, Samios Jannis)"

Caroline Gonda,"It has been argued that the eighteenth century witnessed a decline in paternal authority, and the emergence of more intimate, affectionate relationships between parent and child. In Reading Daughters' Fictions, Caroline Gonda draws on a wide range of novels and non-literary materials from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in order to examine changing representations of the father-daughter bond. She shows that heroine-centred novels, aimed at a predominantly female readership, had an important part to play in female socialization and the construction of heterosexuality, in which the father-daughter relationship had a central role. Contemporary diatribes against novels claimed that reading fiction produced rebellious daughters, fallen women, and nervous female wrecks. Gonda's study of novels of family life and courtship suggests that, far from corrupting the female reader, such fictions helped to maintain rather than undermine familial and social order.","9780521553957, 0521553954  ","Reading Daughters' Fictions 1709-1834: Novels and Society from Manley to Edgeworth (Cambridge Studies in Romanticism),  (English, Hardcover, Caroline Gonda)"

Inokuma Tsubasa,"This work describes novel, effective hydrogen-bond (HB) donor catalysts based on a known bifunctional tertiary amine-thiourea, a privileged structure, which has been proven to be one of the most widely used organocatalysts. These HB donor catalysts derived from quinazoline and benzothiadiazine were initially synthesized as novel HB donors with their HB-donating abilities being measured by analytical methods. They were found to be effective for a variety of asymmetric transformations including Michael reactions of a, b-unsaturated imides and hydrazination reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Thiourea catalysts that have an additional functional group are also described. Specifically, thioureas that bear a hydroxyl group were synthesized and subsequently used as novel bifunctional organocatalysts for catalytic, asymmetric Petasis-type reactions involving organoboronic acids as nucleophiles. These addition reactions were difficult to achieve using existing organocatalysts. One of the developed catalytic methods can be applied to the synthesis of biologically interesting peptide-derived compounds possessing unnatural vinyl glycine moieties. These findings introduce new criteria required for the development of organocatalysts for asymmetric reactions, thus making a significant contribution to the field of organocatalysis.",Science  ,"Development of Novel Hydrogen-Bond Donor Catalysts,  (English, Paperback, Inokuma Tsubasa)"

Romhild Juliane Romhild,"When Elizabeth von Arnim anonymously published her debut Elizabeth and Her German Garden (1898), she became a literary star overnight. The mystery surrounding the identity of this witty aristocratic diarist in her romantic garden kept readers guessing: Who was Elizabeth? A Prussian Princess? The daughter of Queen Victoria? Throughout her long and successful career as one of England's best satirical novelists, von Arnim never officially revealed her identity. Instead, to her readers and friends she simply became known as Elizabeth. From her first book to her capricious autobiography All the Dogs of My Life (1936), throughout her career von Arnim would explore questions of identity and self-representation. And in spite of von Arnim's love of masquerades and guises, her books include funny and surprisingly personal meditations on the challenges of being a woman writer wrestling with a masculine literary tradition, of taking pride in one's commercial success while moving in Modernist circles, and of being both a hard-working professional and an elegant hostess.In tracing the conflict between femininity and authorship in von Arnim's works, this book engages with literary key issues of the time. Von Arnim's early books offer a witty critique of New Woman fiction. Von Arnim's self-positioning on the literary market and her relationships with writers like Katherine Mansfield, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf shed light on the relationship between middlebrow and modernist literature. Von Arnim's complex autobiography, finally, gives a tentative answer to the all-important question: Can a writing woman be a lady?","9781611477030, 1611477034  ","Femininity and Authorship in the Novels of Elizabeth Von Arnim: At Her Most Radiant Moment,  (English, Hardcover, Romhild Juliane Romhild)"

Tennant David R.,"Food Chemical Risk Analysis provides an introduction to the sciences of food chemistry and risk analysis and demonstrates how the potential hazards associated with food chemicals can be assessed and managed. Food scares are never far from the news and particular attention is therefore focused on the consumer perception of risk and risk communication. Leading international experts provide unique insights in the future of food chemical risk analysis. Chapters on alternatives to animal testing show how emerging methods offer the prospect of a more rational human-based approach to toxicity testing. Discussions about relative risks and protective factors highlight the possibility that risks from food can be over-estimated and approaches to avoid such risks are proposed. The science of risk management is presented as more than just a method for translating science into policy by demonstrating how social, psychological, economic ethical and other factors can, and should be taken into account. The book makes it clear that if risk communication is to be effective, an integrated approach to risk analysis must be adopted.",Technology & Engineering  ,"Food Chemical Risk Analysis,  (English, Paperback, Tennant David R.)"

Chris Horrocks Zoran Jetvic,"Illustrated guide to the controversial sociologist Jean Baudrillard, who died in 2007. Did the Gulf War take place? Is it possible to fake a bank robbery? Was sexual liberation a disaster? Jean Baudrillard has been hailed as one of France's most subtle and powerful theorists. But his provocative style and assaults on sociology, feminism and Marxism have exposed him to accusations of promoting a dangerous new orthodoxy - of being the 'pimp' of postmodernism. Introducing Baudrillard cuts beneath the controversy of this misunderstood intellectual to present his radical claims that reality has been replaced by a simulated world of images and events ranging from TV news to Disneyland. It provides a clear account of Baudrillard's work on obesity, pornography and terrorism and traces his development from critic of mass consumption to prophet of the apocalypse.

Pamela K. Gilbert,"Popular fiction in mid-Victorian Britain was regarded as both feminine and diseased. Critical articles of the time on fiction and on the body and disease offer convincing evidence that reading was metaphorically allied with eating, contagion and sex. Anxious critics traced the infection of the imperial, healthy body of masculine elite culture by 'diseased' popular fiction, especially novels by women. This book discusses works by three novelists - M. E. Braddon, Rhoda Broughton, and 'Ouida' - within this historical context. In each case, the comparison of an early, 'sensation' novel against a later work shows how generic categorization worked in the context of social concerns to contain anxiety and limit interpretive possibilities. Within the texts themselves, references to contemporary critical and medical literatures resist or exploit mid-Victorian concepts of health, nationality, class and the body.","9780521593236, 0521593239  ","Disease, Desire, and the Body in Victorian Women's Popular Novels (Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture),  (English, Hardcover, Pamela K.

Hayes Patrick,"'Anti-illusionism is, I suspect, only a marking of time, a phase of recuperation, in the history of the novel. The question is, what next?' (J.M. Coetzee) Patrick Hayes argues that the significance of Coetzees fiction lies in the acuity with which it both explores and develops the tradition of the novelranging from Cervantes, Defoe, and Richardson to Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Beckettas part of a sustained attempt to rethink the relationship between writing and politics. For Coetzee, questions about the future of the novel are closely related to what it means to write after Beckett, and J. M. Coetzee and the Novel examines the ways in whichhis fiction discerningly assimilates the techniques of literary modernism to engage with some of the most troubling aspects of late twentieth-century cultural and political life. While Coetzee is rightly known as an intensely serious writer, Hayes shows that the true seriousness of his writing is intimately bound up with comedyor, to use the word Coetzee borrows from Joyce, the jocoserious. Opening up a range of new approaches to this major contemporary author, J. M. Coetzee and the Novel argues that it is only by paying especially close attention to the experience of reading Coetzees finely-nuanced prose that his distinctive impact on longstanding questionsabout identity, community, and the nature of political modernity can be appreciated.",Literary Criticism  ,"J.M.

Seyedi Mir Hojjat,"This monograph explores Intrabody communication (IBC) as a novel non-RF wireless data communication technique using the human body itself as the communication channel or transmission medium. In particular, the book investigates Intrabody Communication considering limb joint effects within the transmission frequency range 0.3-200 MHz. Based on in-vivo experiments which determine the effects of size, situations, and locations of joints on the IBC, the book proposes a new IBC circuit model explaining elbow joint effects.

Disney Ralph L.,"These two volumes are the Proceedings of the first special interest meeting instigated and organized by the joint Technical Section and College in Applied Probability of ORSA and THlS. This meeting, which took place January 5-7, 1981 at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, had the same name as these Proceedings: Applied Probability-Computer Science, the Interface. The goal of that conference was to achieve a meeting of, and a cross fertilization between, two groups of researchers who, from different starting points, had come to work on similar problems, often developing similar methodologies and tools. One of these groups are the applied probabilists, many of whom consider their field an offspring of mathematics, and who find their motivation in many areas of application. The other is that group of computer scientists who, over the years, have found an increasing need in their work for the use of probabilistic models. The most visible area of common methodology between these two groups is networks of queues, Hhich by itself could have been the theme of an entire conference. FunctionQl areas which are, or are becoming, sources of exciting problems are computer performance analysis, data base analysis, analysis of communication protocols, data networks, and mixed voice-data telephone networks. The reader can add to this list by going through the papers in these Proceedings.",Science  ,"Applied Probability-Computer Science: The Interface Volume 1,  (English, Hardcover, Disney Ralph L.)"
Irwin Marilyn,"An estimated 1 in 110 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although the public awareness of autism has grown significantly, teens are not as educated about this subject as they should be. When accurately and positively presented, literature has been shown to help the classmates of those with ASD better understand the disorder. Increased familiarity with the subject will, in turn, help foster acceptance.In Autism in Young Adult Novels: An Annotated Bibliography, Marilyn Irwin, Annette Y. Goldsmith, and Rachel Applegate identify and assess teen fiction with autism content. In the first section, the authors analyze how characters with ASD are presented. Where do they live and go to school? Do they have friends? Do they have good relationships with their family? How are they treated by others? The authors also consider whether autism is accurately presented. This discussion is followed by a comprehensive bibliography of books that feature a character identified as being on the autism spectrum. The novels reviewed in this volume date as far back as the late 1960s and include works published in the last few years. As more and more authors of young adult fiction become sensitive to ASD, they are featuring such characters in their novels, creating more realistic works for their readers. This study will help librarians and others collect, choose, evaluate, and use these works to educate young adults.",Juvenile Nonfiction  ,"Autism in Young Adult Novels,  (English, Hardcover, Irwin Marilyn)"

Gebreyesus Teklu Bahta,"The writer has attempted to describe, explain and interpret seven Tigrinya novels in the light of a feminist analysis of the historical conditions in which they were produced in order to find the major organization of ideas and values relating to power hierarchy of gender evident in economic, political, linguistic, sexual, cultural and social life of the patriarchal classification of the society. All the novels, written by both male and female novelists, except one, are found to be progressive by the explicate comments they offer and by their stylistic design. The gradual demolition of patriarchal ideology within the novels can be regarded as the symptom of the improvement of the negative stereotypical attitude towards women. The novels could be regarded as vital tools for the interpellation of the individuals into the feminist ideology with a naturalness, spontaneity and experiential immediacy. Such novelistic writing, consumption and criticism can also further promote social revolution and the social transformation of gender power hierarchy parallel to the progress of history.","9783639312386, 3639312384  ","Progressive Gender Power Hierarchy in Seven Tigrigna Novels: Feminist Literary Perspectives,  (English, Paperback, Gebreyesus Teklu Bahta)"

Whether it is her sharp, ironic gaze at the Gothic genre invoked by the adventures of Catherine Morland in ""Northanger Abbey""; the diffident and much put-upon Fanny Price struggling to cope with her emotions in ""Mansfield Park""; her delightfully paced comedy of manners and the machinations of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in ""Sense and Sensibility""; the quiet strength of Anne Elliot in ""Persuasion"" succeeding in a world designed to subjugate her very existence; and Emma - 'a heroine whom no one but myself will like' teased Austen - yet another irresistible character on fire with imagination and foresight.Indeed not unlike her renowned creator, Jane Austen is as sure-footed in her steps through society's whirlpools of convention and prosaic mores as she is in her sometimes restrained but ever precise and enduring prose.","9781840225563, 1840225564  ","The Complete Novels of Jane Austen (Wordsworth Library Collection),  (English, Hardcover, Austen Jane)"

Easterine Kire,"The celebrated novel-the first Naga novel in English-about the legendary battle between Britain and the little warrior village of Khonoma in the nineteenth century, now reissued. Between 1832 and 1880, the Angami warriors of Khonoma were a beacon of Naga resistance against the British, carrying out raids and disrupting the forced recruitment of the Nagas as bonded labourers. In this richly detailed historical novel-the first Naga novel to appear in English-Hindu Prize winner Easterine Kire brings alive Khonoma of the nineteenth century, a natural fortress nestled amidst high mountains. Life in the far-flung Naga hills was ordered by the seasons and the ceaseless labour of both women and men in the fields; by social taboos, rituals and festivals. Young men grew up on stories of valiant battles with rival villages, tigers, spirits and the British. Everyone had a deep connection with the land, and they took pride in fighting and toiling for it. The Khonoma warriors clashed with the British a number of times, stirring other Naga villages to join them as well. After the death of an officer in 1879, the British laid siege upon the tiny village. But despite being outumbered and ill-equipped, Khonoma held out against them for four long months, eventually signing a peace treaty on 27 March, 1880.

Kamala Chandrakant,"Hitopadesha (Good Counsel) is an 11-12th century Sanskrit collection of stories in four chapters instead of five in the Panchatantra on which it is based. Each chapter contains a string of stories, one emerging from the other, with each designed to render counsel on ethical worldly-wise conduct. The characters are living beings including humans and animals in the wild. The latter too are endowed with the reason and emotions of human beings. Thereby they come to represent types of human nature and behavior and one can draw morals from the stories. In this collection, a tiger finds a gold bangle with which he allures a traveler to cross the river; stuck in mire, the greedy man falls easy prey to the tiger. In another story, a jackal feigns friendship with a deer who despite warnings from a wise crow joins the jackal and meets with a tragedy. An old blind vulture is offered shelter by birds in the hollow of a tree. He protects their fledglings. A cat pleads for living with them and the vulture agrees. The cat finishes the fledglings one by one and goes away. The birds suspecting the vulture kill him. Moral: Do not give shelter to the unknown. This collection is treasure house of such stories.","9788184820591, 8184820593  ","Choice of Friends,  (English, Paperback, Kamala Chandrakant)"

Arbuckle Wendall S.,"Ice cream, favorite food of millions. Rich and creamy, sweet and flavorful, pleasing to the palate and the eyes. How rewarding it is to learn about and write about ice cream. The many forms and flavors of these dispersions of tiny air bubbles, ice crystals, fat globules and casein micelles in thick, sweet-flavored syrup have the potential to provide the human sensory receptors with the highest levels of enjoyment. The study of the creation, production, and distribu- tion of ice cream is important to many people. This is why my forebears, Professors W. S. Arbuckle and J. H. Frandsen, wrote the earlier editions of Ice Cream. I am most pleased to have the opportunity to write the fifth edition. It is a complete revision of previous editions. Emphases have been placed on newest technologies and developments in science that affect the ice cream industry. Additionally, many changes took place in the realm of governmental control since the last edition, and these changes have been put in perspective for the reader. The contributions of the previous authors continue to play an important role in the organization and content of the book.

Vlock Deborah,"Dickens' novels, like those of his contemporaries, are more explicitly indebted to the theatre than scholars have supposed: his stories and characters were often already public property by the time they were published, circulating as part of a current theatrical repertoire well known to many Victorian readers. In this 1998 study, Deborah Vlock argues that novels - and novel-readers - were in effect created by the popular theatre in the nineteenth century, and that the possibility of reading and writing narrative was conditioned by the culture of the stage. Vlock resuscitates the long-dead voices of Dickens' theatrical sources, which now only tentatively inhabit reviews, scripts, fiction and non-fiction narratives, but which were everywhere in Dickens' time: voices of noted actors and actresses and of popular theatrical characters. She uncovers unexpected precursors for some popular Dickensian characters, and reconstructs the conditions in which Dickens' novels were initially received.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture: Dickens, Novel Reading, and the Victorian Popular Theatre Series Number 19,  (English, Hardcover, Vlock Deborah)"

A despairing shopkeeper turns to his young son and says, 'This land has nothing to offer us but sand dunes and khejra bushes.' Soon after, twelve-year-old Harilal Tibrewal, recently married to eleven-year-old Parmeshwari, sets off, alone, for the densely populated plains of Bengal in eastern India - travelling on camelback and by bus, train and boat to arrive in Calcutta, two thousand kilometres away...In his new novel, Sujit Saraf takes readers on an epic journey from Shekhavati in Rajasthan to the Calcutta of the early twentieth century, to Bogra in East Bengal and to a village in Bihar in newly independent India. A sprawling, compulsively readable narrative, it follows the story of Harilal as he sets up Harilal &amp; Sons, a shop selling jute, cotton, spices, rice, cigarettes and soap, that grows into a large enterprise. It is also the sweeping tale of his two wives and ever-burgeoning family of sons, daughters, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren-the two strands of family and business inextricably fused because a Marwari’s life is defined by what he 'deals in'.

"Tezuka, Osamu","In book eight, Buddha finally travels home to Kapiluvastu to teach and inspire more followers. There, in the beautiful garden of Jetavana, he explains the original parable of the self-immolating rabbit and reveals the keystone of his philosophy.Originated in the 1970s, the ‘Buddha’ series is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha. Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.About The AuthorOsamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese graphic novels. A genuine intellectual, deeply familiar with Western culture from the Bible to Goethe to Hollywood, Tezuka originally intended to become a doctor and received an M.D. Though many have followed his example, it is still Tezuka who draws the deepest awe with his sweeping vision, deftly intertwined plots, persuasive characters, feel for the workings of power, and above all, an indefatigable commitment to human dignity and the sanctity of life.","9780007251636, 0007251637  ","JETAVANA,  (English, Paperback, Tezuka, Osamu)"

A genuine intellectual, deeply familiar with Western culture from the Bible to Goethe to Hollywood, Tezuka originally intended to become a doctor and received an M.D. Though many have followed his example, it is still Tezuka who draws the deepest awe with his sweeping vision, deftly intertwined plots, persuasive characters, feel for the workings of power, and above all, an indefatigable commitment to human dignity and the sanctity of life.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,"The Forest of Uruvela,  (English, Paperback, Tezuka Osamu)"

Shakespeare William,"Edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, M.A., Ph.D., Emeritus Professor of English, University of Sussex. The Wordsworth Classics' Shakespeare Series presents a newly-edited sequence of William Shakespeare's works. The textual editing takes account of recent scholarship while giving the material a careful reappraisal. The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeare's most popular comedies, but it remains deeply controversial.The text may seem anti-Semitic; yet repeatedly, in performance, it has revealed a contrasting nature.Shylock, though vanquished in the law-court, often triumphs in the theatre. In his intensity he can dominatethe play, challenging abrasively its romantic and lyrical affirmations. What results is a bitter-sweet drama. Though The Merchant of Venice offers some of the traditional pleasures of romantic comedy, it also exposesthe operations of prejudice.
