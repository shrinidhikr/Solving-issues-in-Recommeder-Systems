Anne Frank,"""Anne Frank's diary needs no introduction. This beautifully written memoir of a young girl caught in the middle of one of the most horrific periods of human history, is a testament to the indestructible human will to persevere and survive in the face of the most adverse of circumstances. Where Anne Frank herself became one of the victims of the Second World War, her words, crowding every available inch of space in her diary, survived to keep her story and her memory alive for the rest of the world through the ages . . . About the AuthorBorn in June 1929, Anne Frank would've probably led a life of obscurity had her diary not been published by her father in 1947. She would have remained a number, a faceless statistic lost in some government file, but, it was not to be so. Anne's diary was, for her, a space to express herself in the most honest and candid of terms. She shied away from writing nothing, revealing all and baring her very soul on the pages of the diary. Anne remained in hiding with seven other people in a sealed-off room concealed behind a wooden bookcase in the upper annex of the building her father worked in, in Amsterdam for two years until they were all caught and transported to different concentration camps. Anne Frank was sent to the Bergen-Belsen camp where she died of typhus, a mere two weeks before the camp was liberated by British troops. She was fifteen-years-old.

Art Spiegelman,"The Complete Maus is a graphic novel collecting Art Spiegelman's Maus, A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History as well as And Here My Troubles Begin.Summary of the BookThere are few representations of the Nazi regime which ring with as much truth as Maus. Picture the Nazis as cats, the Jews as mice and the Poles as pigs. Art Spiegelman’s vision of his father’s struggles under the Nazi regime is an apt metaphor which reveals the truly ghastly scenario under the Third Reich. Spiegelman visits his father Vladek who is now married to a woman called Mala in the time since the suicide of Spiegelman’s mother. He informs Vladek that he wants to tell the story of his escape from the Holocaust and his life in Czestochowa. Vladek brushes the effort off in his characteristic style but nevertheless begins telling a story rooted in the mid-1930s. He was a young man who came to marry into a wealthy family. Through his father-in-law’s resources, he moves to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. Following the birth of their first son, Richieu, Vladek’s wife Anja breaks down due to postpartum depression. They go to a sanatorium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. By the time they return home, political and anti-Semitic tensions have already begun to take roots in the country. Vladek is soon drafted just before the invasion. He is soon captured at the front lines and forced into labour as a prisoner of war. The narrative that follows showcases the atrocities of the Nazis and reveals the conditions within the Ghettos. Vladek’s stereotypical nature and Spiegelman’s own reactions to his father’s approaching weakness tell a tale of a son trying to understand a father and the nightmares that he has faced.About Art SpiegelmanItzhak Avraham ben Zeev, better known as Art Spiegelman, is an American cartoonist, editor and comics advocate. He has also worked on The Wild Party, Open Me, I'm A Dog, Jack Cole and Plastic Man, In the Shadow of No Towers and Breakdowns.Spiegelman has won several awards for his work on Maus, including an Eisner Award, a Harvey Award and a Pulitzer Prize.

Rajiv Malhotra,"India is more than a nation state. It is also a unique civilization with philosophies and cosmologies that are markedly distinct from the dominant culture of our times — the West. India's spiritual traditions spring from dharma which has no exact equivalent in Western frameworks. Unfortunately, in the rush to celebrate the growing popularity of India on the world stage, its civilizational matrix is being co-opted into Western universalism, thereby diluting its distinctiveness and potential.In Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism, thinker and philosopher Rajiv Malhotra addresses the challenge of a direct and honest engagement on differences, by reversing the gaze, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer and looking at the West from the dharmic point of view. In doing so, he challenges many hitherto unexamined beliefs that both sides hold about themselves and each other. He highlights that while unique historical revelations are the basis for Western religions, dharma emphasizes self-realization in the body here and now. He also points out the integral unity that underpins dharma's metaphysics and contrasts this with Western thought and history as a synthetic unity.Erudite and engaging, Being Different critiques fashionable reductive translations and analyses the West's anxiety over difference and fixation for order which contrast the creative role of chaos in dharma. It concludes with a rebuttal of Western claims of universalism, while recommending a multi-civilizational worldview.About the AuthorRajiv Malhotra is an Indian-American researcher and public intellectual on current affairs, worlds religions, cross-cultural encounters and science. A scientist by training, he was previously a senior corporate executive, strategic consultant and entrepreneur in information technology and media. He is the author of Breaking India (Amaryllis, 2011), was the chief protagonist in Invading the Sacred (Rupa &amp; Co.), and is an active writer and speaker.

Lalitha Raghupathi,"Kannagi, a gem of a housewife, a 'paragon of chastity' has been immortalised in the pages of Silappadikaaram, the famous Tamil epic of Ilango, the Chera prince-turned-ascetic. It is the story of a clash between three anklets: the anklet of home, the anklet of stage and the anklet of the palace. An ill-fated housewife, Kannagi loses her husband Kovalan, to the art of a dancer, Madhavi, and finds him again to lose him to the blind law of a king. Her story is set in the three ancient cities of South India - Poompuhar, the Chola capital where she grew up, Madurai, the Pandya capital where she fell; and Vanji, the Chera capital which placed her on a pedestal. The epic is a rich record of a great civilization, vivid with descriptions of edifices, shrines, docks, market places and squares, of laws and rituals, Natya Shastra (science of dance), musicology and musical instruments of the day. Known for its high dramatic content, Silappadikaaram is a shining jewel in Tamil literature. The memory of Ilango and his immortal classic has recently been perpetuated by the Tamil Nadu Government by erecting at Kaveripattinam, a magnificent seven-story art gallery 'Silappadikaaram Kalaikoodam' in ancient Dravidian architectural style. The structure narrates the story in stone carvings.","9788184820171, 8184820178  ","Kannagi,  (English, Paperback, Lalitha Raghupathi)"

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Anderson Jon Lee,"Che Guevara's legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of 39, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally famed icon, as revered as he is controversial. A Marxist ideologue, he sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare - and has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of change. In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and Jose Hernandez reveal the man behind the myth, creating a complex portrait of this passionate idealist. Adapted from Anderson's masterwork, Che transports us from young Ernesto's medical school days to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution; from his place of power alongside Castro to his disastrous sojourn in the Congo, and his violent end in Bolivia. Through renowned Mexican artist Jose Hernandez's drawings, we feel the bullets fly past in Cuba; smell the smoke of Castro's cigars; and scrutinize the face of the weary guerrilla as he is called 'Comandante' for the first time. With astonishing precision, colour, and drama, Che makes us first-hand witnesses to the revolutionary life and times of this historic figure. Combining Anderson's unprecedented access and research with Hernandez's emotionally gripping artwork, Che resurrects the man for a new generation of readers.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,"Che Guevara,  (English, Hardcover, Anderson Jon Lee)"

I couldn't put it down' Harper's Bazaar 'Pieces of Me is a brilliantly observed and nuanced look at the war in Iraq and how conflict impacts on the lives of everyone involved' Laura Kaye, author of English Animals 'I devoured this book, and I feel like I'll carry Emma and Adam with me for a long time. Hart tells this devastating story beautifully' Laura Pearson, author of Missing Pieces `Pieces of Me churns with love and rage and hope and terror, as only the best war books can. Natalie Hart writes like a born storyteller, and she uses that gift here to explore how the Iraq War lingers in the dark corners of souls desperate to move on from it. Readers are in for a ride' Matt Gallagher, author of Youngblood `Pieces of Me is a quietly powerful exploration of the complex effects of the Iraq war...The novel builds in power and speaks authoritatively on the polarisation of the lives changed forever by conflict' Zoe Lambert `Natalie Hart's brilliant Pieces of Me is-like Graham Greene's The End of the Affair-a love story set amid the ruins of war. As a British civilian who meets her American husband in Iraq, the narrator, Emma McLaughlin, is a first-hand witness to the ways armed conflict breaks soldiers and non-combatants alike. Her testimony, and this novel, is unforgettably complex and devastating-as it should be' Whitney Terrell, author of The Good Lieutenant `Natalie Hart's vivid novel, Pieces of Me, examines the lives of deployed soldiers' families and displaced Iraqi civilians, eloquently revealing how even the most tightly knit relationships can unravel under the stress of war' Siobhan Fallon, author of You Know When the Men Are Gone and The Confusion of Languages",Fiction  ,"Pieces of Me - Shortlisted for Costa First Novel Award,  (English, Paperback, Hart Natalie)"

Deborah Parsons,"Tracing the developing modernist aesthetic in the thought and writings of James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf, Deborah Parsons considers the cultural, social and personal influences upon the three writers. Exploring the connections between their theories, Parsons pays particular attention to their work on: forms of realism characters and consciousness gender and the novel time and history. An understanding of these three thinkers is fundamental to a grasp on modernism, making this an indispensable guide for students of modernist thought. It is also essential reading for those who wish to understand debates about the genre of the novel or the nature of literary expression, which were given a new impetus by the pioneering figures of Joyce, Richardson and Woolf.","9780415285438, 0415285437  ","Theorists of the Modernist Novel James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf New edition Edition,  (English, Paperback, Deborah Parsons)"

Terry Pratchett,"The Colour of Magic begins Terry Pratchett’s Discworld comic fantasy series, which are set on a flat world shouldered on the top of four elephants resting on a stellar turtle.Summary of the BookThere are an infinite number of things out there in that final frontier called space. There are comets whizzing past, asteroids lost cluelessly, invisible black holes which suck light itself into their loins and a turtle called the Great A'tuin, larger than a planet, silently sailing through the abyss, possibly contemplating breakfast. Atop this turtle stand four elephants, as large as moons. On their shoulders rests a flat world called the Discworld. This world is populated by people of every colour, race and magical orientation possible. It has certain laws, which even though they spit in the face of physics, astronomy and evolutionary biology, are quite inflexible. One of them dictates that when a Wizard is about to die, he will be escorted by Death. The Reaper speaks without vocal cords, in a “voice” like the slamming of coffin lids, needing small caps to say what he needs to. (DO NOT TAKE ME LIGHTLY HUMAN, I WILL COME FOR YOU NEXT. HURRY UP, I’M NEVER LATE. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE GOING TO BE). There are four main continents on this odd planet, and this story occurs on the Unnamed Continent, where the regularly chaotic life of heroes, Wizards and thieves is upset by the arrival of a strangely clad man. He bears a large trunk with several legs called Luggage which has a mind of his own, and in it, he has a lot of gold. He is Twoflower, an odd little man and the Discworld’s first tourist. He quickly hires the failed wizard Rincewind to show him around. However, he might yet regret his choice, for Rincewind was cast out of the greatest institute for magic in the universe: the Unseen Academy. His crime was oddly unique, for he looked into a forbidden book containing a dangerous spell. The spell occupied his entire mind, preventing him from learning any other spells. The spell is so dangerous that all wizards fear it. In fact, it’s so dangerous that no one remembers what it really does!About Terry PratchettSir Terence David John “Terry” Pratchett is a British novelist known for his Discworld series of novels. Pratchett is also known for co-authoring Good Omens with fellow writer Neil Gaiman.Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature and was nominated the Fantasy and Science Fiction Author of the Year by the British Book Awards.The Colour of Magic and its sequel, The Light Fantastic, have been adapted into a two-part TV film by The Mob, a small British studio, starring David Jason, Sean Astin, Tim Curry and Christopher Lee as the voice of Death.Series Reading OrderThis book is the first Discworld novel. Most of the Discworld books are standalone, and they can be read in any order. However, this book directly follows into The Light Fantastic. Below, you will find a helpful guide teaching you how to continue in your voyage through space with the Great A’tuin.If you’re interested in Rincewind, continue with The Light Fantastic, Sourcery, (Faust) Eric, Interesting Times, The Last Continent, The Last Hero and Unseen Academicals.If you’re interested in the machinations of feminist witches, begin with Equal Rites, Wyrd Sisters, Witches Abroad, Lords and Ladies, Maskerade, Carpe Jugulum, The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky and Wintersmith.If you want to know about the ancient civilizations of Discworld, read Pyramids and Small Gods.IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF DEATH, MORTAL, THEN READ Mort, Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time.If you’re interested in Ankh Morpork, the greatest city on Discworld, then you’ll want to read Guards!

Vanessa R. Sasson,"Who was Yasodhara? The Buddha's forgotten and abandoned wife? The mother of his only son? Or an enlightened being in her own right, denied her rightful place in the stories and histories about the Buddha? A long time ago, in a far-off kingdom, a boy and a girl, born on the same day, were destined to be together-and then painfully wrenched apart. The boy was Siddhattha, heir to the Sakya kingdom and the future Buddha; the girl was the beautiful and precocious Yasodhara, his friend who became his loving wife. In this exquisitely crafted narrative, we encounter Yasodhara as a fiercely independent, passionate and resilient individual. We witness her joys and sorrows, her expectations and frustrations, her fairy-tale wedding, and her overwhelming devastation at the departure of her beloved. It is through her eyes that we witness Siddhattha's slow transformation, from a sheltered prince to a deeply sensitive young man. On the way, we see how the gods watch over the future Buddha from the clouds, how the king and his ministers try to keep the suffering of the world from him and how he eventually renounces the throne, his wife and newly-born son to seek enlightenment. Resurrecting a forgotten woman from the origin stories of the Buddha, Vanessa R. Sasson combines the spirit of fiction and the fabulism of Indian mythology with impeccable scholarship, to tell the evocative and deeply moving story of an extraordinary life.About the Author Vanessa R. Sasson is a professor of Religious Studies in the Liberal and Creative Arts and Humanities Department at Marianopolis College, Quebec. She is also a Research Fellow for the International Institute for Studies in Race, Reconciliation and Social Justice at the University of the Free State in South Africa, as well as Adjunct Professor at the Faculty of Religious Studies of McGill University, Montreal. As a scholar, her focus is on Buddhist studies, with particular emphasis on hagiography, gender and childhoods. Vanessa's published books include The Birth of Moses and the Buddha: A Paradigm for the Comparative Study of Religions, and the edited volumes Little Buddhas: Children and Childhoods in Buddhist Texts and Traditions and Imagining the Fetus: The Unborn in Myth, Religion and Culture.",Fiction  ,"Yasodhara - A Novel About the Buddha’s Wife,  (English, Paperback, Vanessa R.

Rowson Martin,"In Martin Rowson's ""The Waste Land"", private detective Chris Marlowe is tasked with getting to the bottom of the most impenetrable of all modernist mysteries: namely T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"". Cunningly contrived, this irreverent graphic parody is inspired in equal parts by the classic modernist poem and by the American noir novels of Raymond Chandler. Marlowe, searching for his dead partner's killers, is lured into a web of murder, deceit, lust, despair, and, of course, a frantic quest for the Holy Grail. Doped, duped, pistol-whipped, framed by the cops, and going nowhere fast, Marlowe enters a nightmare world where Robert Frost, Norman Mailer, and Edmund Wilson drink in the gloom of a London pub; where Auden is glimpsed entering the men's room; where Henry James, Aldous Huxley, and Richard Wagner share an ice cream aboard a Thames pleasure steamer; and where, out of luck and out of clues, Marlowe finally tracks down T.

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Thomas Chris D.,"THE TIMES, ECONOMIST AND GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2017 It is accepted wisdom today that human beings have irrevocably damaged the natural world. Yet what if this narrative obscures a more hopeful truth? In Inheritors of the Earth, renowned ecologist and environmentalist Chris D. Thomas overturns the accepted story, revealing how nature is fighting back. Many animals and plants actually benefit from our presence, raising biological diversity in most parts of the world and increasing the rate at which new species are formed, perhaps to the highest level in Earth's history. From Costa Rican tropical forests to the thoroughly transformed British landscape, nature is coping surprisingly well in the human epoch. Chris Thomas takes us on a gripping round-the-world journey to meet the enterprising creatures that are thriving in the Anthropocene, from York's ochre-coloured comma butterfly to hybrid bison in North America, scarlet-beaked pukekos in New Zealand, and Asian palms forming thickets in the European Alps. In so doing, he questions our irrational persecution of so-called 'invasive species', and shows us that we should not treat the Earth as a faded masterpiece that we need to restore. After all, if life can recover from the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, might it not be able to survive the onslaughts of a technological ape? Combining a naturalist's eye for wildlife with an ecologist's wide lens, Chris Thomas forces us to re-examine humanity's relationship with nature, and reminds us that the story of life is the story of change.",Science  ,"Inheritors of the Earth,  (English, Hardcover, Thomas Chris D.)"

Adams Scott,"The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century is a book in which Scott Adams takes his creativity to a whole new stratosphere. He asserts logically that the greed of humans, along with stupidity and horniness, will shape our near future. Old and new fans of Dilbert should certainly not miss out on this book.Summary of the BookThe Dilbert Future is a comic revolving around the protagonist Dilbert. Dilbert, first published in the year 1989, brings out a satirical style to office humour. The comic strips showcase office politics, which barricades productivity. The place of work is Silicon Valley. Readers connect to situations where employees’ services are not appreciated well enough, and instead busy work is given more prominence. This maladministration leads to amusing circumstances, and makes Dilbert a very popular comic that it is. Dilbert is published in sixty-five countries in the world, in twenty-five different languages, and in two-thousand newspapers across the globe. It has also been featured on the cover of Fortune Magazine numerous times. Dilbert has won the Good Taste Award as the best comic strip of 1996. It was also honoured with the Squiddy Awards and the Zombie Award in 1996 and 1997 for the best daily comic strip. In the year 1997, Dilbert won the Best Syndicated Strip at the Harvey Awards. It was then trailed by the Max &amp; Moritz Prize the successive year. It won the Squiddy Awards again in the year 1998 and 2000 as the Best Comic Strip of the Year.About Scott AdamsScott Raymond Adams is an American comic artist and writer. He is best known as the creator of Dilbert which he uses to point out the irony in corporate environments. Favouring satirical and sarcastic ways of representing the lives of white-collar workers, Adams's work has earned him several awards including the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award and Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 1997. Some of the books compiled based on the Dilbert comic strip are The Dilbert Principle, Dilbert: The Joy of Work, Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel, Dilbert: Another Day in Cubicle Paradise and Your New Job Title is Accomplice.",Humor  ,"The Dilbert Future,  (English, Paperback, Adams Scott)"

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Yagya Sharma,"With Akbar coming to the throne of the Mughal Empire in early 1556, the Mughals had become a part of India. As a conqueror, Akbar triumphed all over North India. He added Gujrat, Bengal, Orissa, Kashmir and Sindh to his empire. He was victorious in Central and South India too. In his efforts to consolidate his empire, Akbar appointed Rajput nobles to the highest posts in his empire. Thus he succeeded in winning the goodwill of the Hindus. The Rajputs flocked to serve him and do him honour.During this period when almost everyone in Northern India had bowed down before Akbar, only the lone, unbending figure of Rana Pratap stood against him. He refused to accept Akbar's supremacy. Had he agreed to surrender, Rana Pratap could have led an easy and comfortable life at the court of Akbar. But for this brave Rajput warrior king, his freedom was his honour, which he cherished even more than his own life. Greatly outnumbered by Akbar's huge forces, Rana lived a hunted life in the jungles and suffered grave hardships. But these sufferings only spurred him on his struggle for freedom.This Chitra Katha presents the tale of Rana Pratap's heroic struggle against the might of the Mughals.","9788184823295, 8184823290  ","Rana Pratap,  (Hindi, Paperback, Yagya Sharma)"

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Matampu Kunhukuttan,"Outcaste ( Brushte in the original Malayalam) is a powerful story of the revenge a single woman named Paptikutty wreaks on her community for the monstrous injustice done to her. It is based on the 1905 trial of a Namboodiri woman for adultery and the revenge she exacted on her sixty-four lovers, who belonged to the most powerful families of the land.

Vikram Kapur,"To Deepa, Prem gave no hint of the churning inside him. In front of her he affected a cheery demeanour, indulging her in her plans for their honeymoon, which she kept revising. It was a welcome escape from the mayhem surrounding him. There were occasions where the pretence got to him and a voice rose inside, urging him to tell her everything. He silenced it. Deepa was a Hindu and would never understand. Until then, he had never thought of her as different. Prem Kohli, the handsome, ambitious son of a Sikh refugee, has the world at his feet. A glittering career lies ahead, and he has just got engaged to his college girlfriend, Deepa, overcoming her parents' reservations about Hindus and Sikhs intermarrying. But, while Deepa remains occupied with their marriage plans, the Indian Army enters the Golden Temple. Prem cannot contain his rising anger at the desecration of the shrine and at the people around him who shrug it off as 'teaching a lesson' to the Sikhs. He begins growing out his hair and beard, and visiting the gurudwara regularly, where he learns about the militancy in Punjab. Matters come to a head a few months later, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is assassinated and anti-Sikh riots break out all over Delhi, as Prem is caught up in a vortex of violence and hate that threatens to engulf all of their lives. In The Assassinations, Vikram Kapur writes with sensitivity about a topic that still holds painful memories, skilfully telling the story of how ordinary lives are distorted by the forces of history. At the same time, he masterfully evokes the New Delhi of the 1980s, with its wide, leafy roads masking the precariousness of its Punjabi middle class. This memorable book captures the turbulence of those times, while chronicling the ways in which continuing to live means coming to terms with many kinds of deaths.About the AuthorVikram Kapur is the author of two other novels, Time Is a Fire and The Wages of Life, as well as the editor of an anthology of short fiction and nonfiction on the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 called 1984 in Memory and Imagination.

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

"Subimal Misra,V. Ramaswamy","Subimal Misra - anarchist, activist, anti-establishment, experimental 'anti-writer' - is a contemporary master, and among India's greatest living authors. This Could Have Become Ramayan Chamar's Tale is a novella about a tea-estate worked turned Naxalite named Ramayan Chamar, who gets arrested during a worker's strike and is beaten up and killed in custody. But every time the author attempts to write that story, reality intrudes in various forms to create a picture of a nation and society that is broken down, and where systemic inequalities are perpetuated by the middle- and upper-classes who are either indifferent or actively malignant. When Colour Is A Warning Sign goes even further in its experimentation, abandoning the barest pretence of narrative and composed entirely as a collage of vignettes, dialogue, reportage, autobiography, etc. Together these two anti-novels are a direct assault on the 'vast conspiracy of not seeing' that makes us look away from the realities of our sociopolitical order. In V.

Herge,"Tintin Explorers On The Moon by Herge regales the adventures of Tintin and his friends as they complete their mission on the moon. Fraught with difficulties and a surprising villain, the story is packed with action.Summary Of The BookTintin Explorers On The Moon, as the name suggests, sees Tintin have an adventure on the moon itself. A continuation of Destination Moon, Tintin, Snowy, Professor Calculus and his assistant Frank Wolff, along with Captain Haddock and Thomson and Thompson, head to the moon on an expedition.The mission is jinxed right from the start with many accidents and obstacles to overcome, the primary one being the presence of two additional members when the rocket has only enough oxygen for four instead of six. Unexpected disasters like Haddock unintentionally engaging in a spacewalk, landing difficulties and Thomson and Thompson sprouting hair that changes color are seen at the beginning of the mission. After the crew lands on the moon, they explore the area in detail. A sudden discovery of an unexpected spy among the gang turns up the tension. A dastardly villain appears and chaos soon ensues. The climax sees Tintin and the villain in a fight to the death. An unexpected casualty and a brave act of remorse is shown as the crew returns to earth.Tintin Explorers On The Moon was written and released a decade before the historic flight of Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. However, Herge was keen on ensuring scientific accuracy with the knowledge available at the time. The rocket bears a resemblance to the V-2 rockets which caught the imagination of the public. Even the checkered design bears a resemblance. Many other such scientific accuracies like water on the moon and inaccuracies like the crew being upside down can be inferred on further analysis. Nevertheless, Tintin Explorers On The Moon features innovative ideas and art in depicting a storyline far from its present realities.About HergeHergé was the pen name of Georges Prosper Remi, a Belgian artist widely known for his work on The Adventures of Tintin. His other works include Quick &amp; Flupke, The Adventures of Tom and Millie, Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Piglet and Jo, Zette and Jocko. He popularised the ligne claire style of art which portrays lines in a uniform fashion contrasted by use of bold colors and realistic backgrounds.

Harriet Beecher Stowe,"""And, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents."" Arthur Shelby, a Kentucky farmer, is heavily in debt. While on the verge of losing his farm and everything else that he owns, Shelby decides to cope up with the financial crisis by selling two of his slaves-the middle-aged Uncle Tom whose faith is unwavering and, the son of Mrs. Emily Shelby's maid Eliza, Harry-to a gruff slave trader named Haley for money. But the Shelby family shares a warm and affectionate relationship with their slaves. What happens when Eliza, who was promised by the virtuous Mrs. Emily Shelby that her son would never be sold, comes to know of the arrangement? A heart-wrenching tale giving insights into the lives of the African American slaves in the pre-Civil War America, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin highlights the evils of slavery.

The bestselling novel and the second bestselling book of the nineteenth century after the Bible, Uncle Tom's Cabin continues to remain a significant part of American literature.About the AuthorBorn on June 14, 1811, in Litchfield, Connecticut, Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe received a traditional academic education at her sister Catherine's school and studied classics and languages. She moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was twenty-one. In Cincinnati, Stowe met several African Americans who had endured the Cincinnati riots of 1829, which took place between the Irish immigrants and the African Americans. Stowe also read a lot of abolitionist literature. She began writing a story about the evils of slavery based on the literature that she had read and her personal observations. The story was first serialized in Washington, D.C.'s abolitionist newspaper The National Era in 1851-52. It was published in book form in 1852 titled Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly. The novel was a sensation when it came out and is considered to have helped ignite the Civil War. After her husband's death in 1886, Stowe's health started deteriorating. She breathed her last on July 1, 1896, aged eighty-five.

Toni Patel,"India in the mid-19th century was under the rule of the British East India Company. The Company's army was largely Indian, commanded by British officers who were often authoritarian and ill informed about local culture. There was significant resentment in local population against foreign rule that surfaced every now and then. The annexation of Oudh in violation of an existing treaty had alienated the company soldiers. In this charged environment, the last straw came in the form of rumors that the new cartridges issued to the army were laced with pig and cow fat. Soldiers needed to tear these cartridges with their teeth before loading rifles. Since the Hindus revered the cow and Muslims considered pigs unclean the news inflamed soldiers of both communities. An open rebellion followed. The first shots were fired by Mangal Pande, a quiet man of the lower ranks. His action started a revolt that grew into an India-wide uprising. Though it did not end colonial rule, it ended the rule of the East India Company. Indians in later years remembered the events of 1857 as the 'First War of Independence' and Mangal Pande, its acclaimed hero.","9788184821956, 8184821956  ","Mangal Pande,  (English, Paperback, Toni Patel)"

A. S. Rao,"Raja Rao is an erudite scholar and an ennobling Indian novelist in English. His sensibility is verily Indian and presents a unified vision of life.His creditable career as a novelist, beginning with his first novel Kanthapura (1938), Spans over almost more than half a century.

Goscinny Rene,"The first ever volume of the famed Asterix comic book series, it is certainly the nostalgic starting point for all Asterix fans.Summary Of The BookThe story begins, as all of Asterix’s adventures do, by invoking the state of Gaul at the time – occupied by the Romans, though not entirely. The one small village of indomitable Gauls still holding out against the invaders is slowly zoomed into. In this first ever adventure, the Romans, led by Centurion Crismus Bonus attempt to figure out what gave the Gauls their superhuman strength. They find that the secret lies in a potion brewed by their fearsome (yet rather fatherly) druid, Getafix. This leads them to their first ever attempt to capture the venerable druid, which they manage to do without a snag, at least initially.The druid is captured and tortured until the torturer is utterly exhausted and stunned by the resistance of Getafix to his methods. Instead, they capture Asterix, who had caught wind of the Romans’ scheme and snuck into their camp, and try to torture him instead, which works brilliantly – so brilliantly that the torturer hardly had to tie him down before the Gaulish warrior began to beg for mercy. This forces Getafix to comply with the Romans’ demand to brew his secret potion for them and goes on to give them an elaborate list of ingredients. But what exactly will the druid concoct? Will it be his famous magic potion or do Asterix and Getafix have other tricks up their sleeves?Asterix The Gaul was named the twenty third most influential book of the twentieth century by the magazine Le Monde. It was first serialized in the French comic magazine Pilote before it was compiled into the well known first volume.

Kamala Chandrakant,"Panchatantra (Five Chapters) in Sanskrit is perhaps the oldest collection of stories in the world and has been translated into more than 50 languages. Each of its 'Chapters' contains a string of stories one emerging from the other, with each designed to lead to a precept for proper practical conduct for a thinking person in the real world. The characters are taken from the whole gamut of living beings including humans and animals in the wild. In a way the unity of life is stressed by assigning the sentiments, emotions and thoughts of human beings to animals as well. The stories here bring out how: scholarship without commonsense can lead to disaster; action imitated thoughtlessly does not yield the desired fruit; hasty acts based on suspicion will make you repent; greed may bring unwanted acquisitions; one life-saving skill is preferable to a thousand clever tricks; it is wise not to allow imagination run wild. These stories are based on a Kannada translation of the Panchatantra.","9788184820461, 8184820461  ","Panchatantra: The Dullard and Other Stories,  (English, Paperback, Kamala Chandrakant)"

Chaturvedi A. K.,"Although rural life has been dealt with in a number of Indian English novels, tribals as such have rarely been depicted in them. This fact testifies to the conspiracy of silence against a large chunk of society that is doomed to remain marginalized and lead life in its periphery. The reasons for this silence are not far to seek in view of the urban and westernized background of Indian English writers and their preoccupation with urban life and its problems. However, the references to tribal life are sporadically mentioned in Arun Joshi’s The Strange Case of Billy Biswas, Kamala Markandaya’s The Coffer Dam, Manohar Malgaonkar’s The Princes, Gita Mehta’s A River Sutra and Kiran Desai’s The Inheritance of Loss. This book is a humble attempt to highlight these references.The book seeks to bring out the similarity between the primitive life as portrayed by the Indian English novelists and as lived by the tribals in the remote rural areas of India. It also brings to light the tribal beliefs and practices, customs and traditions, rites and rituals, feasts and festivals, apparel and adornment, songs and dance as presented in Indian English novel.It is hoped that the students, researchers and even teachers of Indian English literature will find this book interesting and a valuable reference source.About the AuthorA.K. Chaturvedi obtained his Master’s Degree and Ph.D. in English Literature from Agra University. He worked as a lecturer in English in Ganj Dundwara P.G. College, Etah (U.P.) during 1988 89. Thereafter, he joined the Higher Education Department of Madhya Pradesh Government as an Assistant Professor in English and is serving in the same capacity in S.L.P. Government P.G. College, Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh). He has attended a number of National Research Seminars and published several research papers on Indian English novel. He has already accomplished one UGC sponsored minor research project and is working on another project funded by UGC.Table of Contents1. Introduction2. Tribals in Ancient Indian Literature3.

Martin George R. R.,"George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones is brought to life in the pages of this full-colour graphic novel. This is the third volume in what is sure to be one of the most coveted collaborations of the year. Now a major Sky Atlantic TV series from HBO, featuring a stellar cast. When dealing with a masterpiece, only the best will do. That's why writer Daniel Abraham and illustrator Tommy Patterson were chosen to adapt George R. R. Martin's beloved fantasy classic A Game of Thrones as a graphic novel. And as anyone who has read the previous two collected volumes of the ongoing series can attest, the result has been a stunning tour de force faithful in every respect to its brilliant original. In King's Landing, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell-the Hand of King Robert Baratheon-is surrounded by enemies. Some are openly declared, such as Ser Jaime Lannister and his sister, Queen Cersei. Others are hidden in the shadows. Still others wear the smiling mask of friends. But all are deadly, as Eddard is about to discover. Nor is the enmity between Eddard and the Lannister siblings the sole source of friction between these powerful noble families. For Tyrion Lannister, the Imp-whose stunted, twisted body houses the mind of a genius-has but lately won his freedom from Lady Catelyn Stark, Eddard's wife, who had accused him of attempting to murder her youngest son, Brandon. Now he seeks out his father, his restless thoughts bent on revenge. Far to the north, the bastard Jon Snow, newly sworn to the Night's Watch, takes the first faltering steps toward a destiny stranger than he could ever dream-a destiny that will bring him face-to-face with unspeakable horrors from beyond the edge of the world. While across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen, wed to the great Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, and pregnant with his child-a son prophesied to conquer the world-will see her own destiny take an unforeseen turn.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,"A Game of Thrones: Graphic Novel, Volume Three,  (English, Hardcover, Martin George R.

Levine George,"How to Read the Victorian Novel provides a unique introduction to the genre. Using examples from the classics, like The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and Middlemarch, it demonstrates just how unfamiliar their familiarity is. The book attempts to break free of the sense that the Victorian novel is somehow old fashioned, moralizing, and formally careless by emphasizing the complexity, difficulty, and rare pleasures of the Victorian writers' strenuous efforts both to entertain and to teach; to create serious ""art"" and to appeal to wide audiences; to respond both to the demands of publishing and also to their own rich imaginative engagement with a world heading into modernity at full speed. Broad in its scope, the text surveys a wide variety of literary types and explores the cultural and historical developments of the novel form itself. The book also poses a series of ""big questions"" pertaining to money, capitalism, industry, race, gender, and, at the same time, to formal issues, such as plotting, perspective, and realist representation.In addition, it locates the qualities that give to the great variety of Victorian novels a ""family resemblance,"" the material conditions of their production, their tendency to multiply plots, their obsession with class and money, their problematic handling of gender questions, and their commitment to realist representation. How to Read the Victorian Novel challenges our comfortable expectations of the genre in order to explore intensively a burgeoning and changing literary form which mirrors a burgeoning and changing society.",Literary Criticism  ,"How to Read the Victorian Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Levine George)"

McWilliams John,"John McWilliams has written the first, much needed account of the ways the promise and threat of political revolution have informed masterpieces of the historical novel. The jolting sense of historical change caused by the French Revolution led to an immense readership for a new kind of fiction, centered on revolution, counter-revolution and warfare, which soon came to be called ""the historical novel."" During the turbulent wake of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, promptly followed by the phenomenon of Napoleon Bonaparte, the historical novel thus served as a literary hybrid in the most positive sense of that often-dismissive term. It enabled readers to project personal hopes and anxieties about revolutionary change back into national history. While immersed in the fictive lives of genteel, often privileged heroes, readers could measure their own political convictions against the wavering loyalties of their counterparts in a previous but still familiar time. McWilliams provides close readings of some twenty historical novels, from Scott and Cooper through Tolstoy, Zola and Hugo, to Pasternak and Lampedusa, and ultimately to Marquez and Hilary Mantel, but with continuing regard to historical contexts past and present. He traces the transformation of the literary conventions established by Scott's Waverley novels, showing both the continuities and the changes needed to meet contemporary times and perspectives. Although the progressive hopes imbedded in Scott's narrative form proved no longer adaptable to twentieth century carnage and the rise of totalitarianism, the meaning of any single novel emerges through comparison to the tradition of its predecessors. A foreword and epilogue explore the indebtedness of McWilliams's perspective to the Marxist scholarly tradition of Georg Lukacs and Frederic Jameson, while defining his differences from them. This is a scholarly work of no small ambition and achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,"Revolution and the Historical Novel,  (English, Hardcover, McWilliams John)"

Pettitt Clare,"Although much has been written about the history of copyright and authorship in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, very little attention has been given to the impact of the development of other kinds of intellectual property on the ways in which writers viewed their work in this period. This book is the first to suggest that the fierce debates over patent law and the discussion of invention and inventors in popular texts during the nineteenth century informedthe parallel debate over the professional status of authors. The book examines the shared rhetoric surrounding the creation of the 'inventor' and the 'author' in the debate of the 1830s, and the challenge of the emerging technologies of mass production to traditional ideas of art and industry isaddressed in a chapter on authorship at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Subsequent chapters show how novelists Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot participated in debates over the value and ownership of labour in the 1850s, such as patent reform and the controversy over married women's property. The book shows the ways in which these were reflected in their novels. It also suggests that the publication of those novels, and the celebrity of their authors, had a substantial effecton the subsequent direction of these debates. The final chapter shows that Thomas Hardy's later fiction reflects an important shift in thinking about creativity and ownership towards the end of the century. Patent Inventions argues that Victorian writers used the novel not just to reflect, but alsoto challenge received notions of intellectual ownership and responsibility. It ends by suggesting that detailed study of the debate over intellectual property in the nineteenth century leads to a better understanding of the complex negotiations over the bounds of selfhood and social responsibility in the period.",Literary Criticism  ,"Patent Inventions - Intellectual Property and the Victorian Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Pettitt Clare)"

Ingulsrud John E.,"Japanese animation, video games, and manga have attracted fans around the world. The characters, the stories, and the sensibilities that come out of these cultural products are together called Japan Cool. This is not a sudden fad, but is rooted in manga-Japanese comics-which since the mid-1940s have developed in an exponential way. In spite of a gradual decline in readership, manga still commands over a third of the publishing output. The volume of manga works that is being produced and has been through history is enormous. There are manga publications that attract readers of all ages and genders. The diversity in content attracts readers well into adulthood. Surveys on reading practices have found that almost all Japanese people read manga or have done so at some point in their lives. The skills of reading manga are learned by readers themselves, but learned in the context of other readers and in tandem with school learning. Manga reading practices are sustained by the practices of other readers, and manga content therefore serves as a topic of conversation for both families and friends. Moreover, manga is one of the largest sources of content for media production in film, television, and video games. Manga literacy, the practices of the readers, the diversity of titles, and the sheer number of works provide the basis for the movement recognized as Japan Cool. Reading Japan Cool is directed at an audience of students of Japanese studies, discourse analysts, educators, parents, and manga readers.",Social Science  ,"Reading Japan Cool,  (English, Hardcover, Ingulsrud John E.)"

Dames Nicholas,"How did the Victorians read novels? Nicholas Dames answers that deceptively simple question by revealing a now-forgotten range of nineteenth-century theories of the novel, a range based in a study of human physiology during the act of reading, He demonstrates the ways in which the Victorians thought they read, and uncovers surprising responses to the question of what might have transpired in the minds and bodies of readers of Victorian fiction. His detailed studiesof novel critics who were also interested in neurological science, combined with readings of novels by Thackeray, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing, propose a vision of the Victorian novel-reader as far from the quietly immersed being we now imagine - as instead a reader whose nervous system wasaddressed, attacked, and soothed by authors newly aware of the neural operations of their public. Rich in unexpected intersections, from the British response to Wagnerian opera to the birth of speed-reading in the late nineteenth century, The Physiology of the Novel challenges our assumptions about what novel-reading once did, and still does, to the individual reader, and provides new answers to the question of how novels influenced a culture's way of reading, responding, and feeling.",Fiction  ,"The Physiology of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Dames Nicholas)"

Rice reads both Invisible Man and the posthumously published Juneteenth as novels that focus on the political uses of language. He explores Ellison's concept of the novel, promulgated in that author's two collections of essays, as an inherently political form of art. And he carefully considers the political context that undoubtedly impacted Ellison's work and thought: a world and a time rocked to its foundation by such revolutionary actors as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. Rice guides his reader to a greater understanding of Ralph Ellison, his oeuvre, and the American novel.",Literary Criticism  ,"Ralph Ellison and the Politics of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Rice)"

These bonds are some of the strongest known and are fundamental to biological processes. The author describes his discovery that sterically hindered ureas undergo solvolysis at room temperature under neutral conditions. This is a remarkable finding, since ureas are inert under these conditions and a general rule of chemistry is that hindered substrates are less reactive. Remarkably, the author translates these results to the correspondingly sterically hindered amides. This thesis has resulted in a number of outstanding publications in high profile journals. The unique method for breaking urea and amide bonds developed in this study is likely to have far reaching consequences for biological protein manipulation.",Science  ,"Novel Synthetic Chemistry of Ureas and Amides,  (English, Paperback, Hutchby Marc)"

McWilliams John,"John McWilliams has written the first, much needed account of the ways the promise and threat of political revolution have informed masterpieces of the historical novel. The jolting sense of historical change caused by the French Revolution led to an immense readership for a new kind of fiction, centered on revolution, counter-revolution and warfare, which soon came to be called ""the historical novel."" During the turbulent wake of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, promptly followed by the phenomenon of Napoleon Bonaparte, the historical novel thus served as a literary hybrid in the most positive sense of that often-dismissive term. It enabled readers to project personal hopes and anxieties about revolutionary change back into national history. While immersed in the fictive lives of genteel, often privileged heroes, readers could measure their own political convictions against the wavering loyalties of their counterparts in a previous but still familiar time. McWilliams provides close readings of some twenty historical novels, from Scott and Cooper through Tolstoy, Zola and Hugo, to Pasternak and Lampedusa, and ultimately to Marquez and Hilary Mantel, but with continuing regard to historical contexts past and present. He traces the transformation of the literary conventions established by Scott's Waverley novels, showing both the continuities and the changes needed to meet contemporary times and perspectives. Although the progressive hopes imbedded in Scott's narrative form proved no longer adaptable to twentieth century carnage and the rise of totalitarianism, the meaning of any single novel emerges through comparison to the tradition of its predecessors. A foreword and epilogue explore the indebtedness of McWilliams's perspective to the Marxist scholarly tradition of Georg Lukacs and Frederic Jameson, while defining his differences from them. This is a scholarly work of no small ambition and achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,"Revolution and the Historical Novel,  (English, Hardcover, McWilliams John)"

Mizuhara Tsukasa,"The author successfully developed novel anti-HIV PD 404182 derivatives that exhibited submicromolar inhibitory activity against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. His thesis is in three parts. The first part expounds efficient methods for the synthesis of tricyclic heterocycles related to PD 404182 based on the sp2-carbon heteroatom bond formations. Starting from arene or haloarene, C-O, C-N, or C-S bonds were formed by simply changing the reactants. These synthetic methods provide powerful approaches for the divergent preparation of pyrimido-benzoxazine, -quinazoline, or -benzothiazine derivatives. The second part explains SAR studies of PD 404182 for the development of anti-HIV agents. Through optimization studies of the central 1,3-thiazin-2-imine core, the benzene and cyclic amidine ring parts, 3-fold more potent inhibitors were obtained compared with the lead compound. The author also reveals by a time-of-drug-addition experiment that PD 404182 derivatives impaired HIV replication at the binding or fusion stage. The third part of the thesis elucidates the development of photoaffinity probes for the target identification of PD 404182. By the photolabeling experiment of HIV-1-infected H9 cells using these probes, the author detected proteins specifically bound to PD 404182. These new anti-HIV agents may be promising agents for anti-HIV therapy because their mechanisms of action differ from those of the currently approved anti-HIV agents.",Science  ,"Development of Novel Anti-HIV Pyrimidobenzothiazine Derivatives,  (English, Hardcover, Mizuhara Tsukasa)"

In this unusual study of a previously neglected literary form, Amanpal Garcha shows how the literary sketch influenced these authors' careers, transformed the marketplace for fiction and led to the development of some of the Victorian novel's key formal and ideological elements.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture: From Sketch to Novel: The Development of Victorian Fiction Series Number 67,  (English, Hardcover, Garcha Amanpal)"

Carnell Rachel K.,"This book considers why narrative realism in literature is seen as a 'full account' of 'real life' and the individual self. Unconventionally, Carnell shows that the formal conventions of narrative realism emerged in the seventeenth century in response to an explosion of partisan writings that put into play competing versions of political selfhood.",Literary Criticism  ,"Partisan Politics, Narrative Realism, and the Rise of the British Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Carnell Rachel K.)"

Frank Herbert,"The epic that began with the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning classic DUNE continues . . .More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE. Only one link survives with those tumultuous times: the grotesque figure of Leto Atreides, son of the prophet Paul Muad'Dib, and now the virtually immortal God Emperor of Dune.He alone understands the future, and he knows with a terrible certainty that the evolution of his race is at an end unless he can breed new qualities into his species. But to achieve his final victory, Leto Atreides must also bring about his own downfall . . .About the AuthorFrank Herbert (1920-86) was born in Tacoma, Washington and worked as a reporter and later editor of a number of West Coast newspapers before becoming a full-time writer. His first SF story was published in 1952 but he achieved fame more than ten years later with the publication in Analog of 'Dune World' and 'The Prophet of Dune' that were amalgamated in the novel Dune in 1965.",Fiction  ,"God Emperor Of Dune: The Fourth Dune Novel,  (English, Paperback, Frank Herbert)"

Ingulsrud John E.,"Japanese animation, video games, and manga have attracted fans around the world. The characters, the stories, and the sensibilities that come out of these cultural products are together called Japan Cool. This is not a sudden fad, but is rooted in manga-Japanese comics-which since the mid-1940s have developed in an exponential way. In spite of a gradual decline in readership, manga still commands over a third of the publishing output. The volume of manga works that is being produced and has been through history is enormous. There are manga publications that attract readers of all ages and genders. The diversity in content attracts readers well into adulthood. Surveys on reading practices have found that almost all Japanese people read manga or have done so at some point in their lives. The skills of reading manga are learned by readers themselves, but learned in the context of other readers and in tandem with school learning. Manga reading practices are sustained by the practices of other readers, and manga content therefore serves as a topic of conversation for both families and friends. Moreover, manga is one of the largest sources of content for media production in film, television, and video games. Manga literacy, the practices of the readers, the diversity of titles, and the sheer number of works provide the basis for the movement recognized as Japan Cool. Reading Japan Cool is directed at an audience of students of Japanese studies, discourse analysts, educators, parents, and manga readers.",Social Science  ,"Reading Japan Cool,  (English, Hardcover, Ingulsrud John E.)"

,"Drawing on work in critical theory, feminism and social history, this book traces the lines of tension shot through Victorian culture by the fear that the social world was being reduced to a display window behind which people, their actions and their convictions were exhibited for the economic appetites of others. Affecting the most basic elements of Victorian life - the vagaries of desire, the rationalisation of social life, the gendering of subjectivity, the power of nostalgia, the fear of mortality, the cyclical routines of the household - the ambivalence generated by commodity culture organizes the thematic concerns of these novels and the society they represent. Taking the commodity as their point of departure, chapters on Thackeray, Gaskell, Dickens, Eliot, Trollope, and the Great Exhibition of 1851 suggest that Victorian novels provide us with graphic and enduring images of the power of commodities to affect the varied activities and beliefs of individual and social experience.","9780521471336, 0521471338  ","Novels behind Glass: Commodity Culture and Victorian Narrative (Literature, Culture, Theory),  (English, Hardcover, Andrew H.

Barker Martin,"Between 1949 and 1955 Britain was swept by a rising tide of panic about """"American-style"""" or """"horror"""" comics. The British press cried out in alarm: """"Now Ban This Filth That Poisons Our Children,"""" """"Drive Out the Horror Comics."""" As one frenzied columnist protested: """"I feel as though I have been trudging through a sewer. Here is a terrible twilight zone between sanity and madness . . . peopled by monsters, grave robbers, human flesh eaters."""" A campaign against ghoulish comic books climaxed in an Act of Parliament making it illegal to publish or sell any material in comic form deemed to be """"harmful to children.""""But behind the facade of concern for the protection of children, another very different story lurked. This book explores the British campaign by asking some rather different questions. Who were the people at the heart of the anti-comics campaign? Why and how did the British Communist Party come to play a central role, and yet end up attacking a group of comics which were """"on their side"""" in assaulting their rationality of McCarthyism?The British """"horror comics"""" campaign reveals the inadequacy of some conventional assessments of anti-media panics. In showing a curious gap between the private concerns of the campaigners and their public rhetoric, A Haunt of Fears, originally published in Britain in 1983, raises serious questions about the state of British culture during this era.",Political Science  ,"A Haunt of Fears,  (English, Paperback, Barker Martin)"

In a fast changing world wherein anthropogenic climate change, biological invasions, deforestation, desertification, and frequent droughts have become routine hard realities, the contents of this book urge readers to rethink basic notions of setting and accomplishing objectives in mycorrhizal research to make sense vis-a-vis contemporary challenges. In this book, a global perspective of mycorrhizal diversity and distribution is provided, followed by some insights into the impact of various global change elements such as climate change, plant invasion, and extreme environmental conditions on mycorrhizas and the role of these mutualists in turn to help their host plants to withstand such novel selection pressures. Special attention here is given to the interesting, but largely neglected, topics such as the role of mycorrhizas in ecological restoration of degraded environments and mycorrhizal status of aquatic plants. The basic idea is to unify various topical areas in mycorrhizal science in an integrated framework. This book can be used by the undergraduate and graduate level students studying mycorrhizal symbioses in the context of current ecological applications. The materials in this book will benefit biological scientists actively involved in research on mycorrhizal ecology and global environmental change. Besides, the contents of the book could be of special interest to restoration ecologists and biodiversity managers.",Science  ,"Mycorrhizas: Novel Dimensions in the Changing World,  (English, Hardcover, Shah Manzoor Ahmad)"

The clues point to the remains of the sunken ship, one that was once captained by Haddock’s ancestor. However, they are not the only ones looking for the treasure. The expedition they have launched to find it may be their downfall.About HergéGeorges Prosper Remi, better known as Hergé, was a Belgian cartoonist best known for creating the characters in the Tintin comics series. He completed 23 books in the series and is best remembered for: Tintin in Tibet, The Black Island and Prisoners of the Sun.After working for a brief stint at various newspapers, he started serialization of the Tintin stories in 1929. He is considered to have greatly influenced the world of comics, majorly European comics, and was included in the Harvey Award Jack Kirby Hall of Fame and the Eisner Award Hall of Fame as the Judge's choice.

Currently, application oriented engineers are only concerned with their immediate problems, which results in an ad hoc method of problem solving. Researchers, on the other hand, lack an understanding of the practical issues of data-mining for real-world problems and often concentrate on issues that are of no significance to the practitioners. In this volume, we hope to remedy problems by (1) presenting a theoretical foundation of data-mining, and (2) providing important new directions for data-mining research. A set of well respected data mining theoreticians were invited to present their views on the fundamental science of data mining. We have also called on researchers with practical data mining experiences to present new important data-mining topics.",Mathematics  ,"Foundations and Novel Approaches in Data Mining,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

Schmidt first investigates cyclodextrins (CDs), which are well known for the formation of supramolecular host/guest complexes with hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solution. Schmidt then also examines reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization as a well-suited toll for the synthesis of water-soluble end-functionalized polymers. The author skillfully combines both concepts as a powerful tool to access reversibly forming macromolecular architectures. The novel methods and architectures presented in this work are highly interesting from both a fundamental point of view as well as a basis for the design of efficient drug release systems.

Wilson Diana de Armas,"Two sets of related issues prompt this study: the birth of the New World in European consciousness and the rise of the Cervantine novel in Spain. The conquest, exploration, and colonization of the Indies resonate through Cervantes's two novels, Don Quixote (1605, 1615) and the Persiles (1617), both fortified by imperialism. Cervantes begins publishing in the 1580s, just as the might of imperial Spain turned from Europe towards the Atlantic. Twicerefused emigration papers to America - which he depicts as the 'refuge and haven of all the desperate men of Spain' - Cervantes turns to fiction. His novels internalize many colonial discourses and at least four genres implicated in Spain's New World enterprise: the Books of Chivalry, the utopias, the colonial war epic,and American ethnohistory. The first full-length study to move beyond an inventory of Cervantes's references to the Indies - to Mexico and Peru, cannibals and tobacco, parrots and alligators - this book interprets his novels as a transatlantic, cross-cultural, and multi-linguistic achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cervantes, the Novel, and the New World,  (English, Hardcover, Wilson Diana de Armas)"

As with all dynamic industries, the Cereal in- dustry has renewed itself in the past; as the millennium approaches, it is on the brink of another renewal, in which the versatility and providence of cereals are being rediscovered, but in new and exciting ways. Cereals are richly diverse; over 10,000 varieties convert minerals and the energy of the sun into a bursting catalog of functional and versatile biomolecules and biopolymers. Processing technology allows these components to be accessed, separated, isolated and purified, while chemical science allows modification for even greater diversity and speci- ficity. The last century has seen the move from cereal- to oil-based chemical and materials industries. But cereals contain a greater variety and functionality of macromolecules than oil. Starch, protein, bran and straw, already diverse across cereal varieties, can be fraction- ated into more specific elements, modified chemically to enhance function, or used as feedstocks in fermentation-based bioconversion systems, to produce a range of bulk and fine chemicals for industries as diverse as food, pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, pulp and paper, transport, composites and boards, adhesives and energy.",Science  ,"Cereals: Novel Uses and Processes,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

Unlike other critical guides, it not only provides students with examples of significant strands of criticism, but also helps them to make sense of these articles and extracts by means of a narrative and critical framework. The novelists referred to are the acknowledged great names of Victorian fiction, including the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Thomas Hardy, Henry James, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Anthony Trollope. A short opening section describing and representing early critical responses is complemented by a longer second section looking at current themes in criticism, such as genre, gender, politics, science, language, the canon, and modes of production.

Most importantly, once the relevant antigens have been identified, key focus then shifts to the development of suitable delivery systems and formulations to achieve maximum in vivo potency with minimum potential side effects. These novel formulations-many of which will be nanoparticulates-can deliver the antigens to the desired site, to the relevant antigen presenting cells, and prevent systemic exposure of the immune potentiators. The proposed book will outline all the critical steps that need to be considered for successful development of various types of nanoparticulate delivery systems for vaccine antigens. These contributions from leading experts in the area of vaccine formulation and delivery systems will tie in what is the most current status, including clinical evaluations with these novel vaccine technologies.",Medical  ,"Novel Immune Potentiators and Delivery Technologies for Next Generation Vaccines,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

van de Hey Joshua,"In this thesis, a new lidar (light detection and ranging) ceilometer capable of monitoring cloud base and sensitive to boundary layer aerosols is introduced. The key to this novelty lies in its divided-lens design that addresses a classical lidar problem of balancing transmitter-receiver overlap and signal-to-noise ratio, along with a method for characterizing overlap in the laboratory. Enhanced sensitivity in the near-range of the instrument is achieved without compromising signal-to-noise in a design that is straightforward to manufacture for broad deployment. The instrument, its optical characterization, and its performance in the field are described. The prototype instrument described here has since formed the basis of a commercial sensor for monitoring clouds and aerosols. High-resolution, continuous observations of clouds and aerosols are needed to reduce the large uncertainties in our current understanding of their influence on climate that have been highlighted by the International Panel on Climate Change. And as international health organizations indicate growing public health threats over the coming decades resulting from poor air quality, extensive aerosol monitoring is required to assess personal exposure to and the health impacts of anthropogenic particulates. Ground-based optical remote sensing measurements made by well-characterized instruments, such as that described in these pages, are critical to this.",Technology & Engineering  ,"A Novel Lidar Ceilometer,  (English, Hardcover, van de Hey Joshua)"

Dellino Clive V. J.,"The first edition of Cold and Chilled Storage Technology was prepared at a time when great changes were taking place in the industry that were hard to put into clear perspective. For example, the CFClozone layer problem was identified, the Montreal Protocol was signed and experts from many disci- plines were already proposing 'solutions' to the problems seen at the time. Not only were there the usual differences in approach to the problems, there were different understandings of the problems themselves. For in- stance, some authoritative voices were saying HCFC 22 was 'part of the solution, not part of the problem' and recommending it as the main refrig- erant for the future, others said the opposite. As editor, I have taken the view that this should be a 'reference book' and, as such, it should contain information that points in the direction of tried and proven good practice. To avoid the risk of misdirecting readers, I decided that the CFC issue was too unclear to be usefully discussed in the first edition and left it out altogether. This was the main criticism of the first edition at the time of its publication but, in view of the developments since then, I stand by my decision to avoid premature comment in that instance. The matter is discussed in this edition in Chapters 4 and 7, which include summaries of other related factors, in a way that was certainly not possible in 1989.",Technology & Engineering  ,"Cold and Chilled Storage Technology,  (English, Paperback, Dellino Clive V.

MISRA Pravati,"The book aims at an evaluation of the novels of Kamala Markandaya in the perspective of class-consciousness embedded in her fictional narrative. The study attempts to explore the impact of class-consciousness on the attitudes, manners and conditions of living in the context of modern India as it moves from a conservative and traditional social order to a liberal and urbanised socio-economic and cultural ethos. It seeks to explore Markandaya’s concern with the predicament of the individual in a class-ridden society subjected to a process of radical change. An attempt has been made to substantiate the hypothesis that in the process of this change, the self confronts tensions, uncertainties and conflicts that lead to deep psychological and spiritual wounds. The self, with its desires, instincts and dreams, encounters a world of reality governed by social, economic and cultural forces. This encounter leads to a crisis of identity. The self tries to surmount this crisis through resistance or reconciliation, through protest or surrender. In this process of self’s grappling with reality, there is anguish and suffering. This study, in short, is an attempt to exploring the paradox of human condition in terms of conflict between self and society, between free will and necessity.About the AuthorDr. Pravati Misra holds M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from the Utkal University, Orissa. She is a Senior Reader in English in the Orissa State Education Service. At present she teaches in Shailabala Women’s College at Cuttack.

Arthur Golden,"In ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. Sayuri's story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion -- the geisha district of Kyoto -- with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a book of nuance and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos. And though the story is rich with detail and a vast knowledge of history, it is the transparent, seductive voice of Sayuri that the reader remembers.",Fiction  ,"Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel,  (English, Paperback, Arthur Golden)"

Joe Sacco,"'The blessing of an inherently interpretive medium like comics is that it hasn't allowed me to . . . make a virtue of dispassion. For good or for ill, the comics medium is adamant, and it has forced me to make choices. In my view, that is part of its message' - from the preface by Joe Sacco Over the past decade, Joe Sacco has increasingly turned to short-form com-ics journalism to report from conflict zones around the world. Collected here for the first time, Sacco's darkly funny, revealing reportage confirms his standing as one of the foremost international correspondents working today. Journalism takes readers from the smuggling tunnels of Gaza to war crimes trials in The Hague, from the lives of India's 'untouchables' to the ordeal of sub-Saharan refugees washed up on the shores of Malta. Sacco also confronts the misery and absurdity of the war in Iraq, including the darkest chapter in recent American history - the torture of detainees. Vividly depicting Sacco's own interactions with the people he meets, the stories in this remarkable collection argue for the essential truth in comics reportage, an inevitably subjective journalistic endeavour.

Most importantly, once the relevant antigens have been identified, key focus then shifts to the development of suitable delivery systems and formulations to achieve maximum in vivo potency with minimum potential side effects. These novel formulations-many of which will be nanoparticulates-can deliver the antigens to the desired site, to the relevant antigen presenting cells, and prevent systemic exposure of the immune potentiators. The proposed book will outline all the critical steps that need to be considered for successful development of various types of nanoparticulate delivery systems for vaccine antigens. These contributions from leading experts in the area of vaccine formulation and delivery systems will tie in what is the most current status, including clinical evaluations with these novel vaccine technologies.",Medical  ,"Novel Immune Potentiators and Delivery Technologies for Next Generation Vaccines,  (English, Hardcover, unknown)"

This book provides a fresh look at Twain's major novels such as Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. The difficulties in these works are shown to be neither flaws nor failures, but rather intrinsic to both the structure of the American novel and the texture of American culture.","9780521561686, 052156168X  ","Mark Twain and the Novel - The Double-Cross of Authority,  (English, cloth bound, Howe)"

They investigate how the Bard has been worshipped at different times and in different places, used and abused to cultural and political ends, and the roots of intense controversies which have surrounded his work.Much more than a biography or a guide to his plays and sonnets, Introducing Shakespeare is a tour through the world of Will and concludes that even after centuries, Shakespeare remains the battlefield on which our very comprehension of humanity is being fought out.",Literary Criticism  ,"Introducing Shakespeare,  (English, Paperback, Groom Nick)"

Its extensive textual apparatus lists manuscript and first edition variants from the copy-text, which is the corrected eighth edition of 1861 - her last revision of the book. The introduction locates the genesis of the novel in Eliot's family history, her travels, and her reading of literature and biography, and describes the composition process, including her debate with the publisher John Blackwood about the suitability of the subject-matter for a family audience, as both author and publisher anticipated its appearing initially in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Using Blackwood's publication ledgers, it also establishes the details of the eleven complete or nearly complete resettings of the novel in Eliot's lifetime; and examines the author's revisions to a manuscript that is popularly, but erroneously, thought to have been little altered, giving detailed attention to the dialect in the context of more than 900 variants between manuscript and first edition.",Fiction  ,"Adam Bede,  (English, Hardcover, Eliot George)"

In this volume, editors Tahneer Oksman and Seamus O'Malley regard Doucet's and Bell's art as actively feminist, not only because they offer women's perspectives, but because they do so by provocatively bringing up the complicated, multivalent frameworks of such engagements. While each artist has a unique perspective, style, and worldview, the essays in this book investigate their shared investments in formal innovation and experimentation, and in playing with questions of the autobiographical, the fantastic, and the spaces in between. Doucet is a Canadian underground cartoonist, known for her autobiographical works such as Dirty Plotte and My New York Diary. Meanwhile, Bell is a British American cartoonist best known for her intensely introspective semiautobiographical comics and graphic memoirs, such as the Lucky series and Cecil and Jordan in New York. By pairing Doucet alongside Bell, the book recognizes the significance of female networks, and the social and cultural connections, associations, and conditions that shape every work of art. In addition to original essays, this volume republishes interviews with the artists. By reading Doucet's and Bell's comics together in this volume housed in a series devoted to single-creator studies, the book shows how despite the importance of finding """"a place inside yourself"""" to create, this space seems always for better or worse a shared space culled from and subject to surrounding lives, experiences, and subjectivities.",Literary Criticism  ,"The Comics of Julie Doucet and Gabrielle Bell,  (English, Hardcover, unknown)"

Samios Jannis,"The unique behavior of the ""liquid state"", together with the richness of phenomena that are observed, render liquids particularly interesting for the scientific community. Note that the most important reactions in chemical and biological systems take place in solutions and liquid-like environments. Additionally, liquids are utilized for numerous industrial applications. It is for these reasons that the understanding of their properties at the molecular level is of foremost interest in many fields of science and engineering. What can be said with certainty is that both the experimental and theoretical studies of the liquid state have a long and rich history, so that one might suppose this to be essentially a solved problem. It should be emphasized, however, that although, for more than a century, the overall scientific effort has led to a considerable progress, our understanding of the properties of the liquid systems is still incomplete and there is still more to be explored. Basic reason for this is the ""many body"" character of the particle interactions in liquids and the lack of long-range order, which introduce in liquid state theory and existing simulation techniques a number of conceptual and technical problems that require specific approaches. Also, many of the elementary processes that take place in liquids, including molecular translational, rotational and vibrational motions (Trans. -Rot. -Vib. coupling), structural relaxation, energy dissipation and especially chemical changes in reactive systems occur at different and/or extremely short timescales.",Science  ,"Novel Approaches to the Structure and Dynamics of Liquids: Experiments, Theories and Simulations,  (English, Paperback, Samios Jannis)"

Lee Newton,"Disney Stories: Getting to Digital explores how Disney, the man and the company, used technological innovation to create characters and stories that engage audiences in many different media, in particular in Video Games and on the Internet. Drawing on Disney films from the twenties and thirties, as well as the writings of historians, screenwriters and producers, Disney Stories: Getting to Digital explains how new film and animation techniques, many developed by Disney, worked together to evolve character and content development and produce entertaining stories that riveted audiences.

Caroline Gonda,"It has been argued that the eighteenth century witnessed a decline in paternal authority, and the emergence of more intimate, affectionate relationships between parent and child. In Reading Daughters' Fictions, Caroline Gonda draws on a wide range of novels and non-literary materials from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in order to examine changing representations of the father-daughter bond. She shows that heroine-centred novels, aimed at a predominantly female readership, had an important part to play in female socialization and the construction of heterosexuality, in which the father-daughter relationship had a central role. Contemporary diatribes against novels claimed that reading fiction produced rebellious daughters, fallen women, and nervous female wrecks. Gonda's study of novels of family life and courtship suggests that, far from corrupting the female reader, such fictions helped to maintain rather than undermine familial and social order.","9780521553957, 0521553954  ","Reading Daughters' Fictions 1709-1834: Novels and Society from Manley to Edgeworth (Cambridge Studies in Romanticism),  (English, Hardcover, Caroline Gonda)"

Inokuma Tsubasa,"This work describes novel, effective hydrogen-bond (HB) donor catalysts based on a known bifunctional tertiary amine-thiourea, a privileged structure, which has been proven to be one of the most widely used organocatalysts. These HB donor catalysts derived from quinazoline and benzothiadiazine were initially synthesized as novel HB donors with their HB-donating abilities being measured by analytical methods. They were found to be effective for a variety of asymmetric transformations including Michael reactions of a, b-unsaturated imides and hydrazination reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Thiourea catalysts that have an additional functional group are also described. Specifically, thioureas that bear a hydroxyl group were synthesized and subsequently used as novel bifunctional organocatalysts for catalytic, asymmetric Petasis-type reactions involving organoboronic acids as nucleophiles. These addition reactions were difficult to achieve using existing organocatalysts. One of the developed catalytic methods can be applied to the synthesis of biologically interesting peptide-derived compounds possessing unnatural vinyl glycine moieties. These findings introduce new criteria required for the development of organocatalysts for asymmetric reactions, thus making a significant contribution to the field of organocatalysis.",Science  ,"Development of Novel Hydrogen-Bond Donor Catalysts,  (English, Paperback, Inokuma Tsubasa)"

CXCR4 antagonists with different chemical specification are being developed. Pharmacology research guides the way to the rational development effective antagonists. One antagonist, plerixafor, is clinically approved now for stem cell mobilization of lymphoma and myeloma patients. This allows patients to receive potentially life-saving treatment which could not have been administered otherwise. Through early clinical studies it was recognized that CXCR4 antagonists also mobilize malignant hematopoetic cells, i.e. leukemia cells. In preclinical studies a sensitization of mobilized leukemic cells to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy could be shown. Clinical studies are under way. CXCR4 antagonists are an exciting new class of compounds which are also employed for the mobilization of angiogenic cells or for the treatment of solid tumors.

Romhild Juliane Romhild,"When Elizabeth von Arnim anonymously published her debut Elizabeth and Her German Garden (1898), she became a literary star overnight. The mystery surrounding the identity of this witty aristocratic diarist in her romantic garden kept readers guessing: Who was Elizabeth? A Prussian Princess? The daughter of Queen Victoria? Throughout her long and successful career as one of England's best satirical novelists, von Arnim never officially revealed her identity. Instead, to her readers and friends she simply became known as Elizabeth. From her first book to her capricious autobiography All the Dogs of My Life (1936), throughout her career von Arnim would explore questions of identity and self-representation. And in spite of von Arnim's love of masquerades and guises, her books include funny and surprisingly personal meditations on the challenges of being a woman writer wrestling with a masculine literary tradition, of taking pride in one's commercial success while moving in Modernist circles, and of being both a hard-working professional and an elegant hostess.In tracing the conflict between femininity and authorship in von Arnim's works, this book engages with literary key issues of the time. Von Arnim's early books offer a witty critique of New Woman fiction. Von Arnim's self-positioning on the literary market and her relationships with writers like Katherine Mansfield, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf shed light on the relationship between middlebrow and modernist literature. Von Arnim's complex autobiography, finally, gives a tentative answer to the all-important question: Can a writing woman be a lady?","9781611477030, 1611477034  ","Femininity and Authorship in the Novels of Elizabeth Von Arnim: At Her Most Radiant Moment,  (English, Hardcover, Romhild Juliane Romhild)"

Thus, although the field of multimedia database systems is only about 5 years old, it is rapidly becoming a focus for much excitement and research effort. Multimedia database systems are intended to provide unified frameworks for requesting and integrating information in a wide variety of formats, such as audio and video data, document data, and image data. Such data often have special storage requirements that are closely coupled to the various kinds of devices that are used for recording and presenting the data, and for each form of data there are often multiple representations and multiple standards - all of which make the database integration task quite complex. Some of the problems include: - what a multimedia database query means - what kinds of languages to use for posing queries - how to develop compilers for such languages - how to develop indexing structures for storing media on ancillary devices - data compression techniques - how to present and author presentations based on user queries. Although approaches are being developed for a number of these problems, they have often been ad hoc in nature, and there is a need to provide a princi- pled theoretical foundation.",Computers  ,"Multimedia Database Systems,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

Tennant David R.,"Food Chemical Risk Analysis provides an introduction to the sciences of food chemistry and risk analysis and demonstrates how the potential hazards associated with food chemicals can be assessed and managed. Food scares are never far from the news and particular attention is therefore focused on the consumer perception of risk and risk communication. Leading international experts provide unique insights in the future of food chemical risk analysis. Chapters on alternatives to animal testing show how emerging methods offer the prospect of a more rational human-based approach to toxicity testing. Discussions about relative risks and protective factors highlight the possibility that risks from food can be over-estimated and approaches to avoid such risks are proposed. The science of risk management is presented as more than just a method for translating science into policy by demonstrating how social, psychological, economic ethical and other factors can, and should be taken into account. The book makes it clear that if risk communication is to be effective, an integrated approach to risk analysis must be adopted.",Technology & Engineering  ,"Food Chemical Risk Analysis,  (English, Paperback, Tennant David R.)"

Contemporary distribution methods are not without problems however, and specifically related to packaging is the possibility of migration--the contamination of food by components of the materials in contact with it. In this area, both technology and regulations are well developed, but basic science, for a variety of reasons, has tended to advance less quickly. This book addresses the basic science of migration. The editor has brought together a range of authors, all of whom are acknowledged experts in their fields, to provide a timely and concise overview of this important topic. Covering basic science, common materials and the major regulations in North America, Europe and Japan, this book will become a key information source in every library concerned with food technology.

Chris Horrocks Zoran Jetvic,"Illustrated guide to the controversial sociologist Jean Baudrillard, who died in 2007. Did the Gulf War take place? Is it possible to fake a bank robbery? Was sexual liberation a disaster? Jean Baudrillard has been hailed as one of France's most subtle and powerful theorists. But his provocative style and assaults on sociology, feminism and Marxism have exposed him to accusations of promoting a dangerous new orthodoxy - of being the 'pimp' of postmodernism. Introducing Baudrillard cuts beneath the controversy of this misunderstood intellectual to present his radical claims that reality has been replaced by a simulated world of images and events ranging from TV news to Disneyland. It provides a clear account of Baudrillard's work on obesity, pornography and terrorism and traces his development from critic of mass consumption to prophet of the apocalypse.

For several reasons the above topic was singled out and separated from the general Congress. Major advances have recently been made in the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms. These advances serve as the basis for a new generation of therapeutic agents which may potentially alter our approach to inflammatory processes and infectious diseases. The Satellite Symposium focused on recent advances in diversified fields including arachidonate metabolites, actions of cytokines, chemokines, cellular adhesion molecules and novel molecular approaches in the therapy of inflammation. Scholarly addresses were presented by eminent experts in their respective fields. In this book are included 17 papers which describe in detail novel approaches to the study of inflammation.

Pamela K. Gilbert,"Popular fiction in mid-Victorian Britain was regarded as both feminine and diseased. Critical articles of the time on fiction and on the body and disease offer convincing evidence that reading was metaphorically allied with eating, contagion and sex. Anxious critics traced the infection of the imperial, healthy body of masculine elite culture by 'diseased' popular fiction, especially novels by women. This book discusses works by three novelists - M. E. Braddon, Rhoda Broughton, and 'Ouida' - within this historical context. In each case, the comparison of an early, 'sensation' novel against a later work shows how generic categorization worked in the context of social concerns to contain anxiety and limit interpretive possibilities. Within the texts themselves, references to contemporary critical and medical literatures resist or exploit mid-Victorian concepts of health, nationality, class and the body.","9780521593236, 0521593239  ","Disease, Desire, and the Body in Victorian Women's Popular Novels (Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture),  (English, Hardcover, Pamela K.

A dozen neuropeptides have been identified through this approach. Each of these neuropeptides has opened new doors for our understanding of fundamental physiological or behavioral responses. For example the orexins, MCH and ghrelin carry fundamental roles in regulating food intake while neuropeptide S, neuromedin S, the prokineticins and the orexins are major players in modulating sleep and circadian rhythms. The chapters of this book review the latest research in the field, most of them are written by the original discoverers of the respective novel neuropeptide.

Hayes Patrick,"'Anti-illusionism is, I suspect, only a marking of time, a phase of recuperation, in the history of the novel. The question is, what next?' (J.M. Coetzee) Patrick Hayes argues that the significance of Coetzees fiction lies in the acuity with which it both explores and develops the tradition of the novelranging from Cervantes, Defoe, and Richardson to Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Beckettas part of a sustained attempt to rethink the relationship between writing and politics. For Coetzee, questions about the future of the novel are closely related to what it means to write after Beckett, and J. M. Coetzee and the Novel examines the ways in whichhis fiction discerningly assimilates the techniques of literary modernism to engage with some of the most troubling aspects of late twentieth-century cultural and political life. While Coetzee is rightly known as an intensely serious writer, Hayes shows that the true seriousness of his writing is intimately bound up with comedyor, to use the word Coetzee borrows from Joyce, the jocoserious. Opening up a range of new approaches to this major contemporary author, J. M. Coetzee and the Novel argues that it is only by paying especially close attention to the experience of reading Coetzees finely-nuanced prose that his distinctive impact on longstanding questionsabout identity, community, and the nature of political modernity can be appreciated.",Literary Criticism  ,"J.M.

Based on in-vivo experiments which determine the effects of size, situations, and locations of joints on the IBC, the book proposes a new IBC circuit model explaining elbow joint effects. This model not only takes the limb joint effects of the body into account but also considers the influence of measurement equipment in higher frequency band thus predicting signal attenuation behavior over wider frequency ranges.

Disney Ralph L.,"These two volumes are the Proceedings of the first special interest meeting instigated and organized by the joint Technical Section and College in Applied Probability of ORSA and THlS. This meeting, which took place January 5-7, 1981 at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, had the same name as these Proceedings: Applied Probability-Computer Science, the Interface. The goal of that conference was to achieve a meeting of, and a cross fertilization between, two groups of researchers who, from different starting points, had come to work on similar problems, often developing similar methodologies and tools. One of these groups are the applied probabilists, many of whom consider their field an offspring of mathematics, and who find their motivation in many areas of application. The other is that group of computer scientists who, over the years, have found an increasing need in their work for the use of probabilistic models. The most visible area of common methodology between these two groups is networks of queues, Hhich by itself could have been the theme of an entire conference. FunctionQl areas which are, or are becoming, sources of exciting problems are computer performance analysis, data base analysis, analysis of communication protocols, data networks, and mixed voice-data telephone networks. The reader can add to this list by going through the papers in these Proceedings.",Science  ,"Applied Probability-Computer Science: The Interface Volume 1,  (English, Hardcover, Disney Ralph L.)"

unknown,"Protein functionality is big business in the food industry, both academic and commercial. This reflects the fascination of protein chemistry and the commercial value of proteins in giving texture and substance to foods. My first encounter with the subject came about through an interest in assessing the extent of thermal damage in spray-dried proteins. A change in functional properties seemed a useful guide to the thermal damage. I found the literature replete with methods (and theory) and so did what everybody else seemed to do - I devised my own methods which were slight variations on the general theme. However, being an analyst at heart I thought there must be a systematic approach to the various tests available. This book is an attempt to assess the practice of protein functionality testing, keeping theory to a minimum, followed by a suggested 'standard' method or protocol to follow. Each chapter is devoted to a single functional property and the reader will see that attempts to 'standardise' them have had varied success, perhaps reflecting the complexity of the mechanisms at work.

Gebreyesus Teklu Bahta,"The writer has attempted to describe, explain and interpret seven Tigrinya novels in the light of a feminist analysis of the historical conditions in which they were produced in order to find the major organization of ideas and values relating to power hierarchy of gender evident in economic, political, linguistic, sexual, cultural and social life of the patriarchal classification of the society. All the novels, written by both male and female novelists, except one, are found to be progressive by the explicate comments they offer and by their stylistic design. The gradual demolition of patriarchal ideology within the novels can be regarded as the symptom of the improvement of the negative stereotypical attitude towards women. The novels could be regarded as vital tools for the interpellation of the individuals into the feminist ideology with a naturalness, spontaneity and experiential immediacy. Such novelistic writing, consumption and criticism can also further promote social revolution and the social transformation of gender power hierarchy parallel to the progress of history.","9783639312386, 3639312384  ","Progressive Gender Power Hierarchy in Seven Tigrigna Novels: Feminist Literary Perspectives,  (English, Paperback, Gebreyesus Teklu Bahta)"

Young A.,"This book examines class and its representation in Victorian literature, focusing on the emergence of the lower middle class and middle-class responses to it. Arlene Young analyses portraits of white-collar workers, both men and women, who laboured under disparaging misperceptions of their values, abilities, and cultural significance, and shows how these misperceptions were both formulated and resisted. The analysis includes canonical texts like Dickens's Little Dorrit and Gissing's The Odd Women as well as less well-known works by Dinah Mulock Craik, Margaret Oliphant, Amy Levy, Grant Allen, H.G.

Easterine Kire,"The celebrated novel-the first Naga novel in English-about the legendary battle between Britain and the little warrior village of Khonoma in the nineteenth century, now reissued. Between 1832 and 1880, the Angami warriors of Khonoma were a beacon of Naga resistance against the British, carrying out raids and disrupting the forced recruitment of the Nagas as bonded labourers. In this richly detailed historical novel-the first Naga novel to appear in English-Hindu Prize winner Easterine Kire brings alive Khonoma of the nineteenth century, a natural fortress nestled amidst high mountains. Life in the far-flung Naga hills was ordered by the seasons and the ceaseless labour of both women and men in the fields; by social taboos, rituals and festivals. Young men grew up on stories of valiant battles with rival villages, tigers, spirits and the British. Everyone had a deep connection with the land, and they took pride in fighting and toiling for it. The Khonoma warriors clashed with the British a number of times, stirring other Naga villages to join them as well.

van de Hey Joshua,"In this thesis, a new lidar (light detection and ranging) ceilometer capable of monitoring cloud base and sensitive to boundary layer aerosols is introduced. The key to this novelty lies in its divided-lens design that addresses a classical lidar problem of balancing transmitter-receiver overlap and signal-to-noise ratio, along with a method for characterizing overlap in the laboratory. Enhanced sensitivity in the near-range of the instrument is achieved without compromising signal-to-noise in a design that is straightforward to manufacture for broad deployment. The instrument, its optical characterization, and its performance in the field are described. The prototype instrument described here has since formed the basis of a commercial sensor for monitoring clouds and aerosols. High-resolution, continuous observations of clouds and aerosols are needed to reduce the large uncertainties in our current understanding of their influence on climate that have been highlighted by the International Panel on Climate Change. And as international health organizations indicate growing public health threats over the coming decades resulting from poor air quality, extensive aerosol monitoring is required to assess personal exposure to and the health impacts of anthropogenic particulates. Ground-based optical remote sensing measurements made by well-characterized instruments, such as that described in these pages, are critical to this.",Technology & Engineering  ,"A Novel Lidar Ceilometer,  (English, Hardcover, van de Hey Joshua)"

Kamala Chandrakant,"Hitopadesha (Good Counsel) is an 11-12th century Sanskrit collection of stories in four chapters instead of five in the Panchatantra on which it is based. Each chapter contains a string of stories, one emerging from the other, with each designed to render counsel on ethical worldly-wise conduct. The characters are living beings including humans and animals in the wild. The latter too are endowed with the reason and emotions of human beings. Thereby they come to represent types of human nature and behavior and one can draw morals from the stories. In this collection, a tiger finds a gold bangle with which he allures a traveler to cross the river; stuck in mire, the greedy man falls easy prey to the tiger. In another story, a jackal feigns friendship with a deer who despite warnings from a wise crow joins the jackal and meets with a tragedy. An old blind vulture is offered shelter by birds in the hollow of a tree. He protects their fledglings. A cat pleads for living with them and the vulture agrees. The cat finishes the fledglings one by one and goes away. The birds suspecting the vulture kill him. Moral: Do not give shelter to the unknown.

Michael Lackey,"Before the 1970s, there were only a few biographical novels. But starting in the 1980s, there was a veritable explosion of this genre of fiction, leading to the publication of biographical novels about figures as varied as Abraham Lincoln, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Friedrich Nietzsche, Virginia Woolf, Henry James, Frida Kahlo, Zelda Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe, and Sylvia Plath, just to mention a notable few. This publication frenzy culminated in 1999 when two biographical novels (Michael Cunningham's The Hours and Russell Banks' Cloudsplitter) were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and Cunningham's novel won the award. The American Biographical Novel charts the shifts in intellectual history that made the biographical novel acceptable to the literary establishment and popular with the general reading public. More specifically, The American Biographical Novel clarifies the origin and evolution of this genre of fiction, specifies the kind of 'truth' it communicates, provides a framework for identifying how this genre uniquely engages the political, and demonstrates how it gives readers new access to history.","9781628926330, 1628926333  ","The American Biographical Novel,  (English, Paperback, Michael Lackey)"

,"Kautik is prepared to work herself to the bone to feed her husband Mahadev and children Bhima, Nama and Yasodi. She not only drives herself hard, but drives them too, her only concern being that they should keep their dignity intact at all times. She pleads with her husband to pull his weight, often aiming sharp barbs at him. But Mahadev would rather sit under a tree smoking bidis than work. Bhima is a rebel, always on the lookout for opportunities to live a more exciting life. Nama is obedient and suffers for it. Yasodi is too young to make a difference. Ultimately, Kautik is alone in her fight for the family�s survival. However, when she discovers that nothing she does will ever be enough to defeat the calamities that life throws at her one after another, she crumbles, emerging through it all as a tragic heroine of epic proportions. Kautik on Embers is a searing portrayal of the poverty, discrimination and desperation that continue to haunt the villages of rural Maharashtra. Originally published in Marathi in 1960 as Dhag, Uddhav J. Shelke�s terse narrative style and unadorned prose ensured its place in the Marathi literary canon as a modern classic. Shanta Gokhale�s outstanding translation now makes this iconic novel available in English. About the Author - Uddhav J. Shelke (1931�1992) was born in Hinganghat in the Vidarbha district of Maharashtra. After his school education, he joined the Amravati daily, Hindustan, as associate editor. Then he moved to Tapovan, Dr Shivajirao Patwardhan�s colony for people affected with leprosy where he worked as proof-reader, compositor and finally manager of the printing press. He won himself a place in the Marathi literary canon with his first novel, Dhag. His prodigious output of long and short fiction thereafter pandered exclusively to popular taste.

Thackeray William Makepeace,"The quintessential satire of life in early nineteenth-century Britain, Vanity Fair is a panoramic tour of English social strata, charting the rise and fall of the opportunistic Becky Sharp. Rejected by several publishers before finding a place with Bradbury and Evans, this 'novel without a hero' first appeared as a popular serial. The twenty parts were finally printed together in 1848, incorporating the author's own illustrations. Although William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-63) was not a debut author, this was the first of his works to bear his name on the title page; the vast scope of the novel gained him immediate critical acclaim, though reviewers often expressed misgivings about the dark portrayal of human nature. In response, Thackeray wrote that 'we are for the most part an abominably foolish and selfish people ... I want to leave everybody dissatisfied and unhappy at the end of the story.'",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Library Collection - Fiction and Poetry: Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero,  (English, Hardcover, Thackeray William Makepeace)"

unknown,"Alzheimer's disease afflicts up to 1 in 5 people over the age of 65 years and causes untold suffering of the patient and their family. The cause of this disease is unknown; indeed, evidence increasingly suggests that there may be multiple Alzheimer-type syndromes with different etiologies, analogous to different types of psychosis. Currently there are no means to prevent the disease, slow its progress or reverse its neurodegenerative consequences. With few exceptions, clinical trials of a variety of compounds have resulted in patient responses that are disappointing with respect to both the proportion of responders and the magnitude of the responses. Novel approaches to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are clearly warranted. For this reason, we organized the First Suncoast Workshop on the Neurobiology of Aging in St. Petersburg, Florida, which took place from February 26-March 1, 1989. This workshop focused on novel treatments and models for Alzheimer's disease and represented a cooperative venture among academia, government and industry, both in its participants and sponsorship. The Center for the Neurobiology of Aging at the University of Florida, the National Institute on Aging and Taiho Pharmaceutical Corporation in Japan sponsored the workshop in which scientists from the North America, Europe, Japan and other parts of Asia participated.",Science  ,"Novel Approaches to the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

Harriet Beecher Stowe,"""And, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents."" Arthur Shelby, a Kentucky farmer, is heavily in debt. While on the verge of losing his farm and everything else that he owns, Shelby decides to cope up with the financial crisis by selling two of his slaves-the middle-aged Uncle Tom whose faith is unwavering and, the son of Mrs. Emily Shelby's maid Eliza, Harry-to a gruff slave trader named Haley for money. But the Shelby family shares a warm and affectionate relationship with their slaves. What happens when Eliza, who was promised by the virtuous Mrs. Emily Shelby that her son would never be sold, comes to know of the arrangement? A heart-wrenching tale giving insights into the lives of the African American slaves in the pre-Civil War America, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin highlights the evils of slavery. At once fierce and stirring, the book is credited to have fanned the flames of the abolitionist cause. The bestselling novel and the second bestselling book of the nineteenth century after the Bible, Uncle Tom's Cabin continues to remain a significant part of American literature.About the AuthorBorn on June 14, 1811, in Litchfield, Connecticut, Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe received a traditional academic education at her sister Catherine's school and studied classics and languages. She moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was twenty-one. In Cincinnati, Stowe met several African Americans who had endured the Cincinnati riots of 1829, which took place between the Irish immigrants and the African Americans. Stowe also read a lot of abolitionist literature. She began writing a story about the evils of slavery based on the literature that she had read and her personal observations. The story was first serialized in Washington, D.C.'s abolitionist newspaper The National Era in 1851-52. It was published in book form in 1852 titled Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly. The novel was a sensation when it came out and is considered to have helped ignite the Civil War. After her husband's death in 1886, Stowe's health started deteriorating. She breathed her last on July 1, 1896, aged eighty-five. An American abolitionist and a famous author, Harriet Beecher Stowe continues to remain an important figure in world literature.",Literature & Fiction  ,"Uncle Tom's Cabin - The Novel That Inflamed the Abolitionist Cause and Fueled the Events Leading to the American Civil War,  (English, Paperback, Harriet Beecher Stowe)"

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

Currently, application oriented engineers are only concerned with their immediate problems, which results in an ad hoc method of problem solving. Researchers, on the other hand, lack an understanding of the practical issues of data-mining for real-world problems and often concentrate on issues that are of no significance to the practitioners. In this volume, we hope to remedy problems by (1) presenting a theoretical foundation of data-mining, and (2) providing important new directions for data-mining research. A set of well respected data mining theoreticians were invited to present their views on the fundamental science of data mining. We have also called on researchers with practical data mining experiences to present new important data-mining topics.",Mathematics  ,"Foundations and Novel Approaches in Data Mining,  (English, Hardcover, unknown)"

This meeting was the second NATO Silicon on Insulator (SOl) Workshop to be held in st the Ukraine where the first meeting (Gurzuf, Crimea, 1 to 4th November 1994) focussed upon the physical and technical problems to be addressed in order to exploit the advantages of incorporating SOl materials in device and sensor technologies. On this occasion emphasis was placed upon firstly, promoting the use of SOl substrates for a range of novel device and circuit applications and secondly, addressing the economic issues of incorporating SOl processing technologies and device technologies within the framework of the resources available within the laboratories and factories of the Newly Independent States (NIS). The primary goal of both workshops has been the breaking of the barriers that inhibit closer collaboration between scientists and engineers in the NATO countries and the NIS. Indeed, it was a pleasure for attendees at the first meeting to renew acquaintances and for the first time attendees to make new contacts and enjoy the warm hospitality offered by our hosts in Kyiv.

,"The introduction to this volume outlines the critical history of the novel from the moralising reactions of Hawthorne's contemporaries, through the assessments of writers such as Henry James and D. H. Lawrence, to the more recent approaches of the New Criticism, formalism, psychoanalytical criticism, structuralism and feminism. Each of the interpretative essays that follow places The Scarlet Letter in a specific historical and cultural context. The first shows that an awareness of the convention of romance is essential to an understanding of the novel. A second investigates the tension between Hawthorne's Puritan setting and his Romantic language, suggesting a complex relationship among author, narrator, characters, and story. A third considers the novel's pervasive metaphor of sexuality. The final essay locates the work in the genre of 'the novel of adultery'.","9780521319980, 0521319986  ","New Essays on ""The Scarlet Letter"" (The American Novel Series),  (English, Paperback, Emory Elliot, Colacurcio Michael J., Michael J.

Australia has a strong tradition of research in condensed matter physics. The workshops are jointly organised by the School of Physics at the University of New South Wales (Sydney) and the Department of Theoretical Physics, Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University (Canberra). The late Gordon God frey was an Associate Professor of Physics at the University of New South Wales. He bequeathed his estate for the promotion and teaching of theoretical physics within the university.

Inokuma Tsubasa,"This work describes novel, effective hydrogen-bond (HB) donor catalysts based on a known bifunctional tertiary amine-thiourea, a privileged structure, which has been proven to be one of the most widely used organocatalysts. These HB donor catalysts derived from quinazoline and benzothiadiazine were initially synthesized as novel HB donors with their HB-donating abilities being measured by analytical methods. They were found to be effective for a variety of asymmetric transformations including Michael reactions of a, b-unsaturated imides and hydrazination reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Thiourea catalysts that have an additional functional group are also described. Specifically, thioureas that bear a hydroxyl group were synthesized and subsequently used as novel bifunctional organocatalysts for catalytic, asymmetric Petasis-type reactions involving organoboronic acids as nucleophiles. These addition reactions were difficult to achieve using existing organocatalysts. One of the developed catalytic methods can be applied to the synthesis of biologically interesting peptide-derived compounds possessing unnatural vinyl glycine moieties. These findings introduce new criteria required for the development of organocatalysts for asymmetric reactions, thus making a significant contribution to the field of organocatalysis.",Science  ,"Development of Novel Hydrogen-Bond Donor Catalysts,  (English, Paperback, Inokuma Tsubasa)"

One antagonist, plerixafor, is clinically approved now for stem cell mobilization of lymphoma and myeloma patients. This allows patients to receive potentially life-saving treatment which could not have been administered otherwise. Through early clinical studies it was recognized that CXCR4 antagonists also mobilize malignant hematopoetic cells, i.e. leukemia cells. In preclinical studies a sensitization of mobilized leukemic cells to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy could be shown. Clinical studies are under way.

Michael Prince Professor Of Literary History Faculty Of English Howard Erskine-Hill,"This book discusses the intersection between philosophy and literature during the British Enlightenment. Its primary focus is the work of moral philosophers during the first half of the eighteenth century, but its larger interest is in understanding how the writing of philosophical fictions relates to the rise of the novel, and the emergence of philosophical aesthetics. Novelists such as Fielding, Sterne, Johnson and Austen are placed in a philosophical context, and philosophers of the empiricist tradition in the context of English literary history.","9780521550628, 0521550629  ","Philosophical Dialogue in the British Enlightenment: Theology, Aesthetics and the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Michael Prince Professor Of Literary History Faculty Of English Howard Erskine-Hill)"

unknown,"Recently the CXCR4/CXCL12-axis has been recognized as one of the pivotal adhesion pathways by which hematopoietic stem cells are retained in the bone marrow. CXCR4 antagonists with different chemical specification are being developed. Pharmacology research guides the way to the rational development effective antagonists. One antagonist, plerixafor, is clinically approved now for stem cell mobilization of lymphoma and myeloma patients. This allows patients to receive potentially life-saving treatment which could not have been administered otherwise. Through early clinical studies it was recognized that CXCR4 antagonists also mobilize malignant hematopoetic cells, i.e. leukemia cells. In preclinical studies a sensitization of mobilized leukemic cells to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy could be shown. Clinical studies are under way. CXCR4 antagonists are an exciting new class of compounds which are also employed for the mobilization of angiogenic cells or for the treatment of solid tumors. In this book a concise review of the current status of knowledge and future developments will be presented.",Medical  ,"Novel Developments in Stem Cell Mobilization,  (English, Hardcover, unknown)"

Here, Ellen McCracken re-envisions Gerard Genette's paratexts for the present day, arguing that the Internet increases the range, authorship, and reach of the paratextual portals and that they constitute a key element of the creative process of Latino literary production in 21st century America.

unknown,"New experimental observations often require fresh concepts for their interpretation, and at times even changes of paradigms. This is the situation with the recent realization that circulating endothelial progenitor cells may have an important contribution to the maintenance and formation of new endothelium in adult organisms, in a surprisingly wide variety of situations. The classical paradigm of angiogenesis, centered on the notion of ""sprouting"" can hardly accommodate them. It was previously realized that it needs to be ""stretched out"" to include alternative mechanisms of microvascular development, such as intussusception and capillary fusion. However, a major debate where to reconsider the sprouting mechanism, and to promote alternative views, did not take place yet. The number of publications in this field increased exponentially in the last years. Nevertheless, the concepts and notions so much needed to describe and to explain the new observations are still scarce, and heterogeneous. Within the larger community dedicated to the study of angiogenesis, the researchers involved in investigation of circulating precursor endothelial cells biology represent a subgroup with specific preoccupations and opinions. Many of them did not meet each other so far, and no major scientific events have been dedicated before exclusively to their interests. For the above reasons, the idea to organize a symposium addressing the new developments in angiogenesis research was received with enthusiasm by all those involved in its preparation.",Medical  ,"Novel Angiogenic Mechanisms,  (English, Paperback, unknown)"

Dames Nicholas,"How did the Victorians read novels? Nicholas Dames answers that deceptively simple question by revealing a now-forgotten range of nineteenth-century theories of the novel, a range based in a study of human physiology during the act of reading, He demonstrates the ways in which the Victorians thought they read, and uncovers surprising responses to the question of what might have transpired in the minds and bodies of readers of Victorian fiction. His detailed studiesof novel critics who were also interested in neurological science, combined with readings of novels by Thackeray, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing, propose a vision of the Victorian novel-reader as far from the quietly immersed being we now imagine - as instead a reader whose nervous system wasaddressed, attacked, and soothed by authors newly aware of the neural operations of their public. Rich in unexpected intersections, from the British response to Wagnerian opera to the birth of speed-reading in the late nineteenth century, The Physiology of the Novel challenges our assumptions about what novel-reading once did, and still does, to the individual reader, and provides new answers to the question of how novels influenced a culture's way of reading, responding, and feeling.",Fiction  ,"The Physiology of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Dames Nicholas)"

Shah Manzoor Ahmad,"The book provides basic knowledge in mycorrhizal ecology, knitted with novel conceptual frameworks and contemporary perspectives, especially in the context of global change. In a fast changing world wherein anthropogenic climate change, biological invasions, deforestation, desertification, and frequent droughts have become routine hard realities, the contents of this book urge readers to rethink basic notions of setting and accomplishing objectives in mycorrhizal research to make sense vis-a-vis contemporary challenges. In this book, a global perspective of mycorrhizal diversity and distribution is provided, followed by some insights into the impact of various global change elements such as climate change, plant invasion, and extreme environmental conditions on mycorrhizas and the role of these mutualists in turn to help their host plants to withstand such novel selection pressures. Special attention here is given to the interesting, but largely neglected, topics such as the role of mycorrhizas in ecological restoration of degraded environments and mycorrhizal status of aquatic plants. The basic idea is to unify various topical areas in mycorrhizal science in an integrated framework. This book can be used by the undergraduate and graduate level students studying mycorrhizal symbioses in the context of current ecological applications. The materials in this book will benefit biological scientists actively involved in research on mycorrhizal ecology and global environmental change. Besides, the contents of the book could be of special interest to restoration ecologists and biodiversity managers.",Science  ,"Mycorrhizas: Novel Dimensions in the Changing World,  (English, Hardcover, Shah Manzoor Ahmad)"

Rice,"In this engaging study, H.

Rice reads both Invisible Man and the posthumously published Juneteenth as novels that focus on the political uses of language. He explores Ellison's concept of the novel, promulgated in that author's two collections of essays, as an inherently political form of art. And he carefully considers the political context that undoubtedly impacted Ellison's work and thought: a world and a time rocked to its foundation by such revolutionary actors as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. Rice guides his reader to a greater understanding of Ralph Ellison, his oeuvre, and the American novel.",Literary Criticism  ,"Ralph Ellison and the Politics of the Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Rice)"

For several reasons the above topic was singled out and separated from the general Congress. Major advances have recently been made in the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms. These advances serve as the basis for a new generation of therapeutic agents which may potentially alter our approach to inflammatory processes and infectious diseases. The Satellite Symposium focused on recent advances in diversified fields including arachidonate metabolites, actions of cytokines, chemokines, cellular adhesion molecules and novel molecular approaches in the therapy of inflammation. Scholarly addresses were presented by eminent experts in their respective fields. In this book are included 17 papers which describe in detail novel approaches to the study of inflammation.

Vlock Deborah,"Dickens' novels, like those of his contemporaries, are more explicitly indebted to the theatre than scholars have supposed: his stories and characters were often already public property by the time they were published, circulating as part of a current theatrical repertoire well known to many Victorian readers. In this 1998 study, Deborah Vlock argues that novels - and novel-readers - were in effect created by the popular theatre in the nineteenth century, and that the possibility of reading and writing narrative was conditioned by the culture of the stage. Vlock resuscitates the long-dead voices of Dickens' theatrical sources, which now only tentatively inhabit reviews, scripts, fiction and non-fiction narratives, but which were everywhere in Dickens' time: voices of noted actors and actresses and of popular theatrical characters. She uncovers unexpected precursors for some popular Dickensian characters, and reconstructs the conditions in which Dickens' novels were initially received.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture: Dickens, Novel Reading, and the Victorian Popular Theatre Series Number 19,  (English, Hardcover, Vlock Deborah)"

After a comprehensive introduction to the element selenium, the author goes on to report the synthesis of several substrates for carbocyclisation reactions and the use of selenium reagents for the preparation of dihydronaphthalenes. Further chapters detail electrophilic selenium-mediated reactions, and novel strategies using selenium catalysts together with stoichiometric amounts of hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidants to convert stilbene carbosylic acids into the corresponding isocoumarins.

unknown,"Vaccination is one of the most efficient and cost effective methods of promoting human health and has been in clinical use for at least 200 years. Nevertheless, infectious diseases continue to constitute a constant threat to the well being of humanity. Common pathogens, once believed to be under control, acquire increased virulence and resistance to drugs, while exotic microorganisms emerged from hidden reservoirs to cause yet incurable diseases in humans. These changes, together with epidemic outbreaks related to political and socio-economic instabilities, increase the needs for the development of new, advanced vaccines. In this volume, devoted to the proceedings of the 39th OHOLO Conference, we present some of the recent strategies for the design and production of novel vaccines. The advent of recombinant DNA technology has stimulated the production of several subunit vaccines. In spite of the obvious advantages to this approach, the limited immuno- genicity of many subunit candidates has hindered their development. Strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is therefore critical. Several approaches toward this goal, including design of novel adjuvants and delivery systems as well as design of advantageous carriers, are presented here. Among the carriers evaluated here are polypep- tides (flagellin, HBV core antigen, J3-galactosidase), attenuated virions (Vaccinia, Sindbis), and nonpathogenic licensed bacteria (Salmonella).",Medical  ,"Novel Strategies in the Design and Production of Vaccines,  (English, Hardcover, unknown)"

Hashimi Nadia,"A vivid, unforgettable story of an unlikely sisterhood-an emotionally powerful and haunting tale of friendship that illuminates the plight of women in a traditional culture-from the author of the bestselling The Pearl That Broke Its Shell and When the Moon Is Low. For two decades, Zeba was a loving wife, a patient mother, and a peaceful villager. But her quiet life is shattered when her husband, Kamal, is found brutally murdered with a hatchet in the courtyard of their home. Nearly catatonic with shock, Zeba is unable to account for her whereabouts at the time of his death. Her children swear their mother could not have committed such a heinous act. Kamal's family is sure she did, and demands justice. Barely escaping a vengeful mob, Zeba is arrested and jailed.As Zeba awaits trial, she meets a group of women whose own misfortunes have also led them to these bleak cells: thirty-year-old Nafisa, imprisoned to protect her from an honor killing; twenty-five-year-old Latifa, who ran away from home with her teenage sister but now stays in the prison because it is safe shelter; and nineteen-year-old Mezhgan, pregnant and unmarried, waiting for her lover's family to ask for her hand in marriage. Is Zeba a cold-blooded killer, these young women wonder, or has she been imprisoned, as they have been, for breaking some social rule? For these women, the prison is both a haven and a punishment. Removed from the harsh and unforgiving world outside, they form a lively and indelible sisterhood. Into this closed world comes Yusuf, Zeba's Afghan-born, American-raised lawyer, whose commitment to human rights and desire to help his motherland have brought him back. With the fate of this seemingly ordinary housewife in his hands, Yusuf discovers that, like Afghanistan itself, his client may not be at all what he imagines.

Today, however, whole classes of pesticide chemistry have fallen by the wayside due to misuse which generated resistance problems reaching crisis proportions, severe adverse effects on the environment, and public outcry that has led to increasingly stricter regulation and legislation. It is with this background, demanding the need for safer, environmentally friendly pesticides and new strategies to reduce resistance problems, that this book was written. The authors of the various chapters have a wealth of experience in pesticide chemistry, biochemical modes of action, mechanism of resistance and application, and have presented concise reviews. Each is actively involved in thedevelopment of new groups of pesticide chemistry which led to the development of novel insecticides with special impact in controlling agricultural pests. Emphasis has been given to insecticides with selective properties, such as insect growth regulators hormone mimics, ecdysone agonists), (chitin synthesis inhibitors, juvenile chloronicotinyl insecticides (imidacloprid, acetamiprid), botanical insecticides (neem, plant oils), pymetrozine, diafenthiuron, pyrrole insecticides, and others. The importance of these compounds, as components in integrated pest management programs and in insecticide resistance management strategies, is discussed.

Sujit Saraf,"It is the year 1899. In the northwestern corner of British India, the Chhappaniya famine stalks the desert region of Shekhavati. A despairing shopkeeper turns to his young son and says, 'This land has nothing to offer us but sand dunes and khejra bushes.' Soon after, twelve-year-old Harilal Tibrewal, recently married to eleven-year-old Parmeshwari, sets off, alone, for the densely populated plains of Bengal in eastern India - travelling on camelback and by bus, train and boat to arrive in Calcutta, two thousand kilometres away...In his new novel, Sujit Saraf takes readers on an epic journey from Shekhavati in Rajasthan to the Calcutta of the early twentieth century, to Bogra in East Bengal and to a village in Bihar in newly independent India. A sprawling, compulsively readable narrative, it follows the story of Harilal as he sets up Harilal &amp; Sons, a shop selling jute, cotton, spices, rice, cigarettes and soap, that grows into a large enterprise. It is also the sweeping tale of his two wives and ever-burgeoning family of sons, daughters, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren-the two strands of family and business inextricably fused because a Marwari’s life is defined by what he 'deals in'. The novel ends in 1972, as eighty-five-year-old Hari lies dying in the great mansion that he built but never actually lived in. Surrounded by his vast family he wonders why he is still so attached to them. Why has he not reached the third stage in life, the stage of detachment, that his schoolmaster had said he would?Spanning seven decades of an era that saw great tumult in India and Bangladesh, Harilal &amp; Sons is a wonderfully evocative, powerful and capacious narrative-overflowing with a profusion of characters, events and places-contained within the singular life of one man who 'dealt in jute and grain'.About the AuthorSujit Sarafreceived An engineering degree from IIT Delhi and a Ph.D. From Berkeley.

"Tezuka, Osamu","In book eight, Buddha finally travels home to Kapiluvastu to teach and inspire more followers. There, in the beautiful garden of Jetavana, he explains the original parable of the self-immolating rabbit and reveals the keystone of his philosophy.Originated in the 1970s, the ‘Buddha’ series is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha. Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.About The AuthorOsamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese graphic novels.

Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Snowy are called by the Professor to help him with the mission, as a group of people try to sabotage the same.Summary Of The BookTintin, Captain Haddock and Snowy have just returned from one of their many adventures when they are met with the news that their dear friend Professor Calculus has asked them to meet him on an urgent basis in Syldavia. He is in the capital of Syldavia, a city named Klow, and is working, along with the government, on an ambitious and risky programme. On meeting Professor Calculus, they get to know that he has planned an exploration to the Moon, and is currently designing a rocket for the journey. He has invited them to join him in his adventure.Beneath the Sprodj Centre is a land rich in the radioactive element uranium. The Syldavian government and Professor Calculus wish to use this uranium to benefit the entire mankind—they want to explore a magnificent part of the space. But aggressive and evil foreign powers are hell bent on making this difficult for them by planning and plotting to hijack this technology to fulfil their selfish motives which will lead to a catastrophic end.Professor Calculus will achieve his goal, come hail or storm. He wants to reach the moon and needs a companion for the eventful journey too. Will his determination and research pay off? Will he find a friend who is willing to take the huge plunge with him?Hergé wrote this adventure 16 years before the first successful mission to the moon and was lauded for getting many of the facts regarding the landing uncannily right, well before its time. The story in this book is continued in the next book of the series, Explorers On The Moon.About HergéHergé is the pen name for Georges Prosper Remi, who was born on 22nd May, 1907. He was a Belgian comics writer and an illustrator. He is best known for The Adventures of Tintin series, for which he wrote 23 completed comic books from 1929 until his death.He is famously known for his multiple comic book series such as Quick and Flupke (1930-1940), Popol Out West (1934), Jo, Zette and Jocko (1936-1957), and They Explored The Moon (1969).It was in his early years that Hergé developed a love of cinema, particularly favouring Winsor McCay's animated film Gertie the Dinosaur and the films featuring Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from these early films in style and content. During the Second World War, when Hergé was still writing the Adventures of Tintin series, he placed more emphasis on characters than plot, and indeed Tintin's most memorable companions, Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus, were introduced at this time.He was born in his parents' home in Etterbeek, Brussels, a central suburb in the capital city of Belgium. He is one of Belgium’s national heroes. He married twice—to Germaine Kieckens and to Fanny Vlamynck. Hergé died on the 3rd of March, 1983.","9781405206273, 1405206276  ","The Adventures Of Tintin: Destination Moon,  (English, Paperback, Herge)"

Tezuka Osamu,"In book four, unfulfilled by the teachings of renowned ascetics, Siddhartha agrees to follow Dhepa into the forest of trials. But the final ordeal of little Assjai proves to be his most poignant lesson.As Siddhartha searches his heart and yearns for his family, the Kosalans discover the true caste of their queen – a despised shudra, disguised as a noble kshatriya. For the insult, the Buddha’s homeland will pay dearly.Originated in the 1970s, Buddha is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha.Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression.Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.About The AuthorOsamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese graphic novels. A genuine intellectual, deeply familiar with Western culture from the Bible to Goethe to Hollywood, Tezuka originally intended to become a doctor and received an M.D. Though many have followed his example, it is still Tezuka who draws the deepest awe with his sweeping vision, deftly intertwined plots, persuasive characters, feel for the workings of power, and above all, an indefatigable commitment to human dignity and the sanctity of life.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,"The Forest of Uruvela,  (English, Paperback, Tezuka Osamu)"

Toni Patel,"India in the mid-19th century was under the rule of the British East India Company. The Company's army was largely Indian, commanded by British officers who were often authoritarian and ill informed about local culture. There was significant resentment in local population against foreign rule that surfaced every now and then. The annexation of Oudh in violation of an existing treaty had alienated the company soldiers. In this charged environment, the last straw came in the form of rumors that the new cartridges issued to the army were laced with pig and cow fat. Soldiers needed to tear these cartridges with their teeth before loading rifles. Since the Hindus revered the cow and Muslims considered pigs unclean the news inflamed soldiers of both communities. An open rebellion followed. The first shots were fired by Mangal Pande, a quiet man of the lower ranks. His action started a revolt that grew into an India-wide uprising. Though it did not end colonial rule, it ended the rule of the East India Company.

unknown,"In Tales Of Birbal (3 in 1), Anant Pai, brings us three stories that describe Birbal’s wit, intelligence and sense of justice.Summary Of The BookBirbal was one of the nine jewels of Emperor Akbar’s court. He was a brave and fearless soldier, a loyal minister, and a very efficient administrator. But among all his qualities, the one that made him the Emperor’s favourite was his quick and razor sharp wit. He was the Emperor’s most trusted minister, his most reliable advisor, who helped him rule the kingdom impartially and justly, and also entertained him with his wit.Birbal’s real name was Mahesh Das. The stories of his wit and wisdom have made him legendary. Emperor Akbar depended on this minister when it came to making important decisions. Birbal helped the Emperor in dispensing justice, and in dealing diplomatically with other kings and rulers. He also kept the Emperor grounded, and always stopped him from falling prey to arrogance and ignorance. On numerous occasions, he saved the Emperor from taking wrong decisions and punishing the innocent. Birbal’s best quality, however, was that he could make the Emperor laugh. These stories of his wit, his sense of justice, his ability to always outwit his opponents, are undoubtedly the favourite among young readers.In Tales Of Birbal (3 in 1), Anant Pai brings us three of Birbal’s most loved tales, Birbal The Wise, Birbal The Clever, and Birbal To The Rescue. These ancient tales of Birbal’s wit and wisdom reveal why these tales continue to be popular even today.About Anant PaiAnant Pai was popularly, and lovingly known as Uncle Pai to children all over the country.

Chambers Robert W.,"With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies. 'I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled with horror which at all times assails me yet'. With its strange, imaginative blend of horror, science fiction, romance and lyrical prose, Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow is a classic masterpiece of weird fiction. This series of vaguely connected stories is linked by the presence of a monstrous and suppressed book which brings fright, madness and spectral tragedy to all those who read it. An air of futility and doom pervade these pages like a sweet insidious poison. Dare you read it? This collection has been called the most important book in American supernatural fiction between Poe and the moderns. H. P.

Amitava Kumar,"‘There is a buoyant energy and hilarity to this account of an Indian student seeking the wide world through the women he meets, but one laughs with growing unease as a darker undercurrent is slowly revealed.’ —Kiran DesaiThe Lovers is about a man in search of a love story. This man, our narrator, is Kailash—a new immigrant, eager to shine. His friends teasingly call him Kalashnikov, and sometimes AK-47, even AK. In his account of his years at a university in New York, AK takes us through the bittersweet arc of youth and love. There is discovery and disappointment. There are the brilliant women, Jennifer and Nina and Cai Yan. There is the political texture of campus life and the charismatic professor overseeing these young men and women, Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Eqbal Ahmad). Manifest in AK’s first years and first loves is the wild enthusiasm of youth, its idealism, chaotic desires and confusions.A decidedly modern novel that melds story and reportage, anecdote and annotation, picture and text, fragment and essay, The Lovers reminds us of the works of John Berger and Teju Cole. Funny, meditative, and shot through with waves of longing, the book explores feelings of discomfort about cultural misunderstandings and the lack of clarity between men and women. At heart though, it is an investigation of love—‘love despite, or in spite of; love beyond and across dividing lines’.",Erotic fiction  ,"THE LOVERS - A Novel,  (English, Hardcover, Amitava Kumar)"

He is remembered for his valour, courage, sense of justice and above all his burning patriotism, due to which he succeeded in expelling the Sakas from Western India. The incidents narrated in this book are based on Devi Chandragupta by Visakhadatta. This work is now lost, but a few passages from it, quoted in other books, give us a glimpse of the events narrated in it.

Chandragupta Vikramaditya's reign brought about peace and prosperity to a wide area extending from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea and from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas.

The Wordsworth Classics' Shakespeare Series presents a newly-edited sequence of William Shakespeare's works. The textual editing takes account of recent scholarship while giving the material a careful reappraisal. The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeare's most popular comedies, but it remains deeply controversial.The text may seem anti-Semitic; yet repeatedly, in performance, it has revealed a contrasting nature.Shylock, though vanquished in the law-court, often triumphs in the theatre. In his intensity he can dominatethe play, challenging abrasively its romantic and lyrical affirmations. What results is a bitter-sweet drama. Though The Merchant of Venice offers some of the traditional pleasures of romantic comedy, it also exposesthe operations of prejudice.

Though a woman was not easily allowed to rule over a people in those days, she had all the qualities required in an administrator. Her father therefore willed her heir to the throne in preference to her less able stepbrothers. Sensing the objections from courtiers to her ascension to the throne, Razia proclaimed allegiance to one of her stepbrother. He however turned out to be inefficient and Razia was made the queen. She proved herself a just and fair ruler, and abolished the tax on Hindu subjects for their non-islamic faith. Court intrigues continued against her and Sultana (queen) Razia could rule for barely three and a half years. She died in one of the battles with the courtiers, ""for no fault other than that she was a woman"" as a historian said.","9788184822854, 8184822855  ","Sultana Razia,  (English, Paperback, Anant Pai)"
