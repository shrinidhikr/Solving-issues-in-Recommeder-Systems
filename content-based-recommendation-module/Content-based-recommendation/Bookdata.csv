Rajiv Malhotra,"India is more than a nation state. It is also a unique civilization with philosophies and cosmologies that are markedly distinct from the dominant culture of our times ÃÂÃÂ the West. India's spiritual traditions spring from dharma which has no exact equivalent in Western frameworks. Unfortunately, in the rush to celebrate the growing popularity of India on the world stage, its civilizational matrix is being co-opted into Western universalism, thereby diluting its distinctiveness and potential.In Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism, thinker and philosopher Rajiv Malhotra addresses the challenge of a direct and honest engagement on differences, by reversing the gaze, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer and looking at the West from the dharmic point of view. In doing so, he challenges many hitherto unexamined beliefs that both sides hold about themselves and each other. He highlights that while unique historical revelations are the basis for Western religions, dharma emphasizes self-realization in the body here and now. He also points out the integral unity that underpins dharma's metaphysics and contrasts this with Western thought and history as a synthetic unity.Erudite and engaging, Being Different critiques fashionable reductive translations and analyses the West's anxiety over difference and fixation for order which contrast the creative role of chaos in dharma. It concludes with a rebuttal of Western claims of universalism, while recommending a multi-civilizational worldview.",Philosophy  ,BEING DIFFERENT

Anderson Jon Lee,"Che Guevara's legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of 39, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally famed icon, as revered as he is controversial. A Marxist ideologue, he sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare - and has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of change. In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and Jose Hernandez reveal the man behind the myth, creating a complex portrait of this passionate idealist. Adapted from Anderson's masterwork, Che transports us from young Ernesto's medical school days to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution; from his place of power alongside Castro to his disastrous sojourn in the Congo, and his violent end in Bolivia. Through renowned Mexican artist Jose Hernandez's drawings, we feel the bullets fly past in Cuba; smell the smoke of Castro's cigars; and scrutinize the face of the weary guerrilla as he is called 'Comandante' for the first time. With astonishing precision, colour, and drama, Che makes us first-hand witnesses to the revolutionary life and times of this historic figure. Combining Anderson's unprecedented access and research with Hernandez's emotionally gripping artwork, Che resurrects the man for a new generation of readers.",Comics & Graphic Novels  ,Che Guevara

Vanessa R. Sasson,"Who was Yasodhara? The Buddha's forgotten and abandoned wife? The mother of his only son? Or an enlightened being in her own right, denied her rightful place in the stories and histories about the Buddha? A long time ago, in a far-off kingdom, a boy and a girl, born on the same day, were destined to be together-and then painfully wrenched apart. The boy was Siddhattha, heir to the Sakya kingdom and the future Buddha; the girl was the beautiful and precocious Yasodhara, his friend who became his loving wife. In this exquisitely crafted narrative, we encounter Yasodhara as a fiercely independent, passionate and resilient individual. We witness her joys and sorrows, her expectations and frustrations, her fairy-tale wedding, and her overwhelming devastation at the departure of her beloved. It is through her eyes that we witness Siddhattha's slow transformation, from a sheltered prince to a deeply sensitive young man. On the way, we see how the gods watch over the future Buddha from the clouds, how the king and his ministers try to keep the suffering of the world from him and how he eventually renounces the throne, his wife and newly-born son to seek enlightenment. Resurrecting a forgotten woman from the origin stories of the Buddha, Vanessa R.

Rowson Martin,"In Martin Rowson's ""The Waste Land"", private detective Chris Marlowe is tasked with getting to the bottom of the most impenetrable of all modernist mysteries: namely T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"". Cunningly contrived, this irreverent graphic parody is inspired in equal parts by the classic modernist poem and by the American noir novels of Raymond Chandler. Marlowe, searching for his dead partner's killers, is lured into a web of murder, deceit, lust, despair, and, of course, a frantic quest for the Holy Grail. Doped, duped, pistol-whipped, framed by the cops, and going nowhere fast, Marlowe enters a nightmare world where Robert Frost, Norman Mailer, and Edmund Wilson drink in the gloom of a London pub; where Auden is glimpsed entering the men's room; where Henry James, Aldous Huxley, and Richard Wagner share an ice cream aboard a Thames pleasure steamer; and where, out of luck and out of clues, Marlowe finally tracks down T.

Thomas Chris D.,"THE TIMES, ECONOMIST AND GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2017 It is accepted wisdom today that human beings have irrevocably damaged the natural world. Yet what if this narrative obscures a more hopeful truth? In Inheritors of the Earth, renowned ecologist and environmentalist Chris D. Thomas overturns the accepted story, revealing how nature is fighting back. Many animals and plants actually benefit from our presence, raising biological diversity in most parts of the world and increasing the rate at which new species are formed, perhaps to the highest level in Earth's history. From Costa Rican tropical forests to the thoroughly transformed British landscape, nature is coping surprisingly well in the human epoch. Chris Thomas takes us on a gripping round-the-world journey to meet the enterprising creatures that are thriving in the Anthropocene, from York's ochre-coloured comma butterfly to hybrid bison in North America, scarlet-beaked pukekos in New Zealand, and Asian palms forming thickets in the European Alps. In so doing, he questions our irrational persecution of so-called 'invasive species', and shows us that we should not treat the Earth as a faded masterpiece that we need to restore. After all, if life can recover from the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, might it not be able to survive the onslaughts of a technological ape? Combining a naturalist's eye for wildlife with an ecologist's wide lens, Chris Thomas forces us to re-examine humanity's relationship with nature, and reminds us that the story of life is the story of change.",Science  ,Inheritors of the Earth

"Subimal Misra,V. Ramaswamy","Subimal Misra - anarchist, activist, anti-establishment, experimental 'anti-writer' - is a contemporary master, and among India's greatest living authors. This Could Have Become Ramayan Chamar's Tale is a novella about a tea-estate worked turned Naxalite named Ramayan Chamar, who gets arrested during a worker's strike and is beaten up and killed in custody. But every time the author attempts to write that story, reality intrudes in various forms to create a picture of a nation and society that is broken down, and where systemic inequalities are perpetuated by the middle- and upper-classes who are either indifferent or actively malignant. When Colour Is A Warning Sign goes even further in its experimentation, abandoning the barest pretence of narrative and composed entirely as a collage of vignettes, dialogue, reportage, autobiography, etc. Together these two anti-novels are a direct assault on the 'vast conspiracy of not seeing' that makes us look away from the realities of our sociopolitical order. In V. Ramaswamy's translation, they make for difficult, challenging but ultimately immensely powerful reading.",Indian Writing  ,This Could Have Become Ramayan Chamar's Tale: Two Anti-Novels

Goscinny Rene,"The first ever volume of the famed Asterix comic book series, it is certainly the nostalgic starting point for all Asterix fans.Summary Of The BookThe story begins, as all of AsterixÃÂÃÂs adventures do, by invoking the state of Gaul at the time ÃÂÃÂ occupied by the Romans, though not entirely. The one small village of indomitable Gauls still holding out against the invaders is slowly zoomed into. In this first ever adventure, the Romans, led by Centurion Crismus Bonus attempt to figure out what gave the Gauls their superhuman strength. They find that the secret lies in a potion brewed by their fearsome (yet rather fatherly) druid, Getafix. This leads them to their first ever attempt to capture the venerable druid, which they manage to do without a snag, at least initially.The druid is captured and tortured until the torturer is utterly exhausted and stunned by the resistance of Getafix to his methods. Instead, they capture Asterix, who had caught wind of the RomansÃÂÃÂ scheme and snuck into their camp, and try to torture him instead, which works brilliantly ÃÂÃÂ so brilliantly that the torturer hardly had to tie him down before the Gaulish warrior began to beg for mercy. This forces Getafix to comply with the RomansÃÂÃÂ demand to brew his secret potion for them and goes on to give them an elaborate list of ingredients. But what exactly will the druid concoct? Will it be his famous magic potion or do Asterix and Getafix have other tricks up their sleeves?Asterix The Gaul was named the twenty third most influential book of the twentieth century by the magazine Le Monde.

Chaturvedi A. K.,"Although rural life has been dealt with in a number of Indian English novels, tribals as such have rarely been depicted in them. This fact testifies to the conspiracy of silence against a large chunk of society that is doomed to remain marginalized and lead life in its periphery. The reasons for this silence are not far to seek in view of the urban and westernized background of Indian English writers and their preoccupation with urban life and its problems. However, the references to tribal life are sporadically mentioned in Arun JoshiÃÂÃÂs The Strange Case of Billy Biswas, Kamala MarkandayaÃÂÃÂs The Coffer Dam, Manohar MalgaonkarÃÂÃÂs The Princes, Gita MehtaÃÂÃÂs A River Sutra and Kiran DesaiÃÂÃÂs The Inheritance of Loss. This book is a humble attempt to highlight these references.The book seeks to bring out the similarity between the primitive life as portrayed by the Indian English novelists and as lived by the tribals in the remote rural areas of India. It also brings to light the tribal beliefs and practices, customs and traditions, rites and rituals, feasts and festivals, apparel and adornment, songs and dance as presented in Indian English novel.It is hoped that the students, researchers and even teachers of Indian English literature will find this book interesting and a valuable reference source",Literary Criticism  ,Tribals in Indian English Novel

Levine George,"How to Read the Victorian Novel provides a unique introduction to the genre. Using examples from the classics, like The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and Middlemarch, it demonstrates just how unfamiliar their familiarity is. The book attempts to break free of the sense that the Victorian novel is somehow old fashioned, moralizing, and formally careless by emphasizing the complexity, difficulty, and rare pleasures of the Victorian writers' strenuous efforts both to entertain and to teach; to create serious ""art"" and to appeal to wide audiences; to respond both to the demands of publishing and also to their own rich imaginative engagement with a world heading into modernity at full speed. Broad in its scope, the text surveys a wide variety of literary types and explores the cultural and historical developments of the novel form itself. The book also poses a series of ""big questions"" pertaining to money, capitalism, industry, race, gender, and, at the same time, to formal issues, such as plotting, perspective, and realist representation.In addition, it locates the qualities that give to the great variety of Victorian novels a ""family resemblance,"" the material conditions of their production, their tendency to multiply plots, their obsession with class and money, their problematic handling of gender questions, and their commitment to realist representation. How to Read the Victorian Novel challenges our comfortable expectations of the genre in order to explore intensively a burgeoning and changing literary form which mirrors a burgeoning and changing society.",Literary Criticism  ,How to Read the Victorian Novel
McWilliams John,"John McWilliams has written the first, much needed account of the ways the promise and threat of political revolution have informed masterpieces of the historical novel. The jolting sense of historical change caused by the French Revolution led to an immense readership for a new kind of fiction, centered on revolution, counter-revolution and warfare, which soon came to be called ""the historical novel."" During the turbulent wake of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, promptly followed by the phenomenon of Napoleon Bonaparte, the historical novel thus served as a literary hybrid in the most positive sense of that often-dismissive term. It enabled readers to project personal hopes and anxieties about revolutionary change back into national history. While immersed in the fictive lives of genteel, often privileged heroes, readers could measure their own political convictions against the wavering loyalties of their counterparts in a previous but still familiar time. McWilliams provides close readings of some twenty historical novels, from Scott and Cooper through Tolstoy, Zola and Hugo, to Pasternak and Lampedusa, and ultimately to Marquez and Hilary Mantel, but with continuing regard to historical contexts past and present. He traces the transformation of the literary conventions established by Scott's Waverley novels, showing both the continuities and the changes needed to meet contemporary times and perspectives. Although the progressive hopes imbedded in Scott's narrative form proved no longer adaptable to twentieth century carnage and the rise of totalitarianism, the meaning of any single novel emerges through comparison to the tradition of its predecessors. A foreword and epilogue explore the indebtedness of McWilliams's perspective to the Marxist scholarly tradition of Georg Lukacs and Frederic Jameson, while defining his differences from them. This is a scholarly work of no small ambition and achievement.",Literary Criticism  ,Revolution and the Historical Novel

Pettitt Clare,"Although much has been written about the history of copyright and authorship in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, very little attention has been given to the impact of the development of other kinds of intellectual property on the ways in which writers viewed their work in this period. This book is the first to suggest that the fierce debates over patent law and the discussion of invention and inventors in popular texts during the nineteenth century informedthe parallel debate over the professional status of authors. The book examines the shared rhetoric surrounding the creation of the 'inventor' and the 'author' in the debate of the 1830s, and the challenge of the emerging technologies of mass production to traditional ideas of art and industry isaddressed in a chapter on authorship at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Subsequent chapters show how novelists Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot participated in debates over the value and ownership of labour in the 1850s, such as patent reform and the controversy over married women's property. The book shows the ways in which these were reflected in their novels. It also suggests that the publication of those novels, and the celebrity of their authors, had a substantial effecton the subsequent direction of these debates. The final chapter shows that Thomas Hardy's later fiction reflects an important shift in thinking about creativity and ownership towards the end of the century. Patent Inventions argues that Victorian writers used the novel not just to reflect, but alsoto challenge received notions of intellectual ownership and responsibility. It ends by suggesting that detailed study of the debate over intellectual property in the nineteenth century leads to a better understanding of the complex negotiations over the bounds of selfhood and social responsibility in the period.",Literary Criticism  ,Patent Inventions - Intellectual Property and the Victorian Novel

Ingulsrud John E.,"Japanese animation, video games, and manga have attracted fans around the world. The characters, the stories, and the sensibilities that come out of these cultural products are together called Japan Cool. This is not a sudden fad, but is rooted in manga-Japanese comics-which since the mid-1940s have developed in an exponential way. In spite of a gradual decline in readership, manga still commands over a third of the publishing output. The volume of manga works that is being produced and has been through history is enormous. There are manga publications that attract readers of all ages and genders. The diversity in content attracts readers well into adulthood. Surveys on reading practices have found that almost all Japanese people read manga or have done so at some point in their lives. The skills of reading manga are learned by readers themselves, but learned in the context of other readers and in tandem with school learning. Manga reading practices are sustained by the practices of other readers, and manga content therefore serves as a topic of conversation for both families and friends. Moreover, manga is one of the largest sources of content for media production in film, television, and video games. Manga literacy, the practices of the readers, the diversity of titles, and the sheer number of works provide the basis for the movement recognized as Japan Cool. Reading Japan Cool is directed at an audience of students of Japanese studies, discourse analysts, educators, parents, and manga readers.",Social Science  ,Reading Japan Cool
Dames Nicholas,"How did the Victorians read novels? Nicholas Dames answers that deceptively simple question by revealing a now-forgotten range of nineteenth-century theories of the novel, a range based in a study of human physiology during the act of reading, He demonstrates the ways in which the Victorians thought they read, and uncovers surprising responses to the question of what might have transpired in the minds and bodies of readers of Victorian fiction. His detailed studiesof novel critics who were also interested in neurological science, combined with readings of novels by Thackeray, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing, propose a vision of the Victorian novel-reader as far from the quietly immersed being we now imagine - as instead a reader whose nervous system wasaddressed, attacked, and soothed by authors newly aware of the neural operations of their public. Rich in unexpected intersections, from the British response to Wagnerian opera to the birth of speed-reading in the late nineteenth century, The Physiology of the Novel challenges our assumptions about what novel-reading once did, and still does, to the individual reader, and provides new answers to the question of how novels influenced a culture's way of reading, responding, and feeling.",Fiction  ,The Physiology of the Novel

The theoretical chapters are a model of elegantly styled accommodation; yet they brook no fudging of the issues, no comfortable ambiguities - Modern Fiction Studies The Transformation of the English Novel, 1890-1930: Studies in Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence, Forster and Woolf is a provocative exploration of a crucial period in the development of the English novel, integrating critical theory, historical background and sophisticated close reading. Divided into two major sections, the first shows how historical and contextual material is essential for developing powerful readings. The second section is theoretical and speaks of the transformation in the way that we read and think about authors, readers, characters and form in the light of recent theory, offering an alternative to the deconstructive and Marxist trends in literary studies.",Literary Criticism  ,"The Transformation of the English Novel, 1890-1930"
Rice,"In this engaging study, H. William Rice illuminates the mystery that is Ralph Ellison: the author of one complex, important novel who failed to complete his second; a black intellectual who remained notably reticent on political issues during the desegregation of his native South. Rice reads both Invisible Man and the posthumously published Juneteenth as novels that focus on the political uses of language. He explores Ellison's concept of the novel, promulgated in that author's two collections of essays, as an inherently political form of art. And he carefully considers the political context that undoubtedly impacted Ellison's work and thought: a world and a time rocked to its foundation by such revolutionary actors as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. Rice guides his reader to a greater understanding of Ralph Ellison, his oeuvre, and the American novel.",Literary Criticism  ,Ralph Ellison and the Politics of the Novel
Hutchby Marc,"In this thesis, the author investigates the chemistry and application of molecules containing urea and amide bonds. These bonds are some of the strongest known and are fundamental to biological processes. The author describes his discovery that sterically hindered ureas undergo solvolysis at room temperature under neutral conditions. This is a remarkable finding, since ureas are inert under these conditions and a general rule of chemistry is that hindered substrates are less reactive. Remarkably, the author translates these results to the correspondingly sterically hindered amides. This thesis has resulted in a number of outstanding publications in high profile journals. The unique method for breaking urea and amide bonds developed in this study is likely to have far reaching consequences for biological protein manipulation.",Science  ,Novel Synthetic Chemistry of Ureas and Amides

Mizuhara Tsukasa,"The author successfully developed novel anti-HIV PD 404182 derivatives that exhibited submicromolar inhibitory activity against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. His thesis is in three parts. The first part expounds efficient methods for the synthesis of tricyclic heterocycles related to PD 404182 based on the sp2-carbon heteroatom bond formations. Starting from arene or haloarene, C-O, C-N, or C-S bonds were formed by simply changing the reactants. These synthetic methods provide powerful approaches for the divergent preparation of pyrimido-benzoxazine, -quinazoline, or -benzothiazine derivatives. The second part explains SAR studies of PD 404182 for the development of anti-HIV agents. Through optimization studies of the central 1,3-thiazin-2-imine core, the benzene and cyclic amidine ring parts, 3-fold more potent inhibitors were obtained compared with the lead compound. The author also reveals by a time-of-drug-addition experiment that PD 404182 derivatives impaired HIV replication at the binding or fusion stage. The third part of the thesis elucidates the development of photoaffinity probes for the target identification of PD 404182. By the photolabeling experiment of HIV-1-infected H9 cells using these probes, the author detected proteins specifically bound to PD 404182. These new anti-HIV agents may be promising agents for anti-HIV therapy because their mechanisms of action differ from those of the currently approved anti-HIV agents.",Science  ,Development of Novel Anti-HIV Pyrimidobenzothiazine Derivatives

In a fast changing world wherein anthropogenic climate change, biological invasions, deforestation, desertification, and frequent droughts have become routine hard realities, the contents of this book urge readers to rethink basic notions of setting and accomplishing objectives in mycorrhizal research to make sense vis-a-vis contemporary challenges. In this book, a global perspective of mycorrhizal diversity and distribution is provided, followed by some insights into the impact of various global change elements such as climate change, plant invasion, and extreme environmental conditions on mycorrhizas and the role of these mutualists in turn to help their host plants to withstand such novel selection pressures. Special attention here is given to the interesting, but largely neglected, topics such as the role of mycorrhizas in ecological restoration of degraded environments and mycorrhizal status of aquatic plants. The basic idea is to unify various topical areas in mycorrhizal science in an integrated framework. This book can be used by the undergraduate and graduate level students studying mycorrhizal symbioses in the context of current ecological applications.

Cervantes begins publishing in the 1580s, just as the might of imperial Spain turned from Europe towards the Atlantic. Twicerefused emigration papers to America - which he depicts as the 'refuge and haven of all the desperate men of Spain' - Cervantes turns to fiction. His novels internalize many colonial discourses and at least four genres implicated in Spain's New World enterprise: the Books of Chivalry, the utopias, the colonial war epic,and American ethnohistory.

van de Hey Joshua,"In this thesis, a new lidar (light detection and ranging) ceilometer capable of monitoring cloud base and sensitive to boundary layer aerosols is introduced. The key to this novelty lies in its divided-lens design that addresses a classical lidar problem of balancing transmitter-receiver overlap and signal-to-noise ratio, along with a method for characterizing overlap in the laboratory. Enhanced sensitivity in the near-range of the instrument is achieved without compromising signal-to-noise in a design that is straightforward to manufacture for broad deployment. The instrument, its optical characterization, and its performance in the field are described. The prototype instrument described here has since formed the basis of a commercial sensor for monitoring clouds and aerosols. High-resolution, continuous observations of clouds and aerosols are needed to reduce the large uncertainties in our current understanding of their influence on climate that have been highlighted by the International Panel on Climate Change. And as international health organizations indicate growing public health threats over the coming decades resulting from poor air quality, extensive aerosol monitoring is required to assess personal exposure to and the health impacts of anthropogenic particulates.

Dellino Clive V. J.,"The first edition of Cold and Chilled Storage Technology was prepared at a time when great changes were taking place in the industry that were hard to put into clear perspective. For example, the CFClozone layer problem was identified, the Montreal Protocol was signed and experts from many disci- plines were already proposing 'solutions' to the problems seen at the time. Not only were there the usual differences in approach to the problems, there were different understandings of the problems themselves. For in- stance, some authoritative voices were saying HCFC 22 was 'part of the solution, not part of the problem' and recommending it as the main refrig- erant for the future, others said the opposite. As editor, I have taken the view that this should be a 'reference book' and, as such, it should contain information that points in the direction of tried and proven good practice. To avoid the risk of misdirecting readers, I decided that the CFC issue was too unclear to be usefully discussed in the first edition and left it out altogether. This was the main criticism of the first edition at the time of its publication but, in view of the developments since then, I stand by my decision to avoid premature comment in that instance. The matter is discussed in this edition in Chapters 4 and 7, which include summaries of other related factors, in a way that was certainly not possible in 1989.",Technology & Engineering  ,Cold and Chilled Storage Technology

MISRA Pravati,"The book aims at an evaluation of the novels of Kamala Markandaya in the perspective of class-consciousness embedded in her fictional narrative. The study attempts to explore the impact of class-consciousness on the attitudes, manners and conditions of living in the context of modern India as it moves from a conservative and traditional social order to a liberal and urbanised socio-economic and cultural ethos. It seeks to explore MarkandayaÃÂÃÂs concern with the predicament of the individual in a class-ridden society subjected to a process of radical change. An attempt has been made to substantiate the hypothesis that in the process of this change, the self confronts tensions, uncertainties and conflicts that lead to deep psychological and spiritual wounds. The self, with its desires, instincts and dreams, encounters a world of reality governed by social, economic and cultural forces. This encounter leads to a crisis of identity. The self tries to surmount this crisis through resistance or reconciliation, through protest or surrender. In this process of selfÃÂÃÂs grappling with reality, there is anguish and suffering. This study, in short, is an attempt to exploring the paradox of human condition in terms of conflict between self and society, between free will and necessity.",Literary Criticism  ,Class Consciousness in the Novels of Kamala Markandaya
Arthur Golden,"In ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. Sayuri's story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion -- the geisha district of Kyoto -- with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. But as World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself all over again to find a rare kind of freedom on her own terms. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a book of nuance and vivid metaphor, of memorable characters rendered with humor and pathos. And though the story is rich with detail and a vast knowledge of history, it is the transparent, seductive voice of Sayuri that the reader remembers.",Fiction  ,Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel

Using Blackwood's publication ledgers, it also establishes the details of the eleven complete or nearly complete resettings of the novel in Eliot's lifetime; and examines the author's revisions to a manuscript that is popularly, but erroneously, thought to have been little altered, giving detailed attention to the dialect in the context of more than 900 variants between manuscript and first edition.",Fiction  ,Adam Bede

Samios Jannis,"The unique behavior of the ""liquid state"", together with the richness of phenomena that are observed, render liquids particularly interesting for the scientific community. Note that the most important reactions in chemical and biological systems take place in solutions and liquid-like environments. Additionally, liquids are utilized for numerous industrial applications. It is for these reasons that the understanding of their properties at the molecular level is of foremost interest in many fields of science and engineering. What can be said with certainty is that both the experimental and theoretical studies of the liquid state have a long and rich history, so that one might suppose this to be essentially a solved problem. It should be emphasized, however, that although, for more than a century, the overall scientific effort has led to a considerable progress, our understanding of the properties of the liquid systems is still incomplete and there is still more to be explored. Basic reason for this is the ""many body"" character of the particle interactions in liquids and the lack of long-range order, which introduce in liquid state theory and existing simulation techniques a number of conceptual and technical problems that require specific approaches. Also, many of the elementary processes that take place in liquids, including molecular translational, rotational and vibrational motions (Trans. -Rot. -Vib. coupling), structural relaxation, energy dissipation and especially chemical changes in reactive systems occur at different and/or extremely short timescales.",Science  ,"Novel Approaches to the Structure and Dynamics of Liquids: Experiments, Theories and Simulations"

Inokuma Tsubasa,"This work describes novel, effective hydrogen-bond (HB) donor catalysts based on a known bifunctional tertiary amine-thiourea, a privileged structure, which has been proven to be one of the most widely used organocatalysts. These HB donor catalysts derived from quinazoline and benzothiadiazine were initially synthesized as novel HB donors with their HB-donating abilities being measured by analytical methods. They were found to be effective for a variety of asymmetric transformations including Michael reactions of a, b-unsaturated imides and hydrazination reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Thiourea catalysts that have an additional functional group are also described. Specifically, thioureas that bear a hydroxyl group were synthesized and subsequently used as novel bifunctional organocatalysts for catalytic, asymmetric Petasis-type reactions involving organoboronic acids as nucleophiles. These addition reactions were difficult to achieve using existing organocatalysts. One of the developed catalytic methods can be applied to the synthesis of biologically interesting peptide-derived compounds possessing unnatural vinyl glycine moieties. These findings introduce new criteria required for the development of organocatalysts for asymmetric reactions, thus making a significant contribution to the field of organocatalysis.",Science  ,Development of Novel Hydrogen-Bond Donor Catalysts

Tennant David R.,"Food Chemical Risk Analysis provides an introduction to the sciences of food chemistry and risk analysis and demonstrates how the potential hazards associated with food chemicals can be assessed and managed. Food scares are never far from the news and particular attention is therefore focused on the consumer perception of risk and risk communication. Leading international experts provide unique insights in the future of food chemical risk analysis. Chapters on alternatives to animal testing show how emerging methods offer the prospect of a more rational human-based approach to toxicity testing. Discussions about relative risks and protective factors highlight the possibility that risks from food can be over-estimated and approaches to avoid such risks are proposed. The science of risk management is presented as more than just a method for translating science into policy by demonstrating how social, psychological, economic ethical and other factors can, and should be taken into account. The book makes it clear that if risk communication is to be effective, an integrated approach to risk analysis must be adopted.",Technology & Engineering  ,Food Chemical Risk Analysis

Contemporary distribution methods are not without problems however, and specifically related to packaging is the possibility of migration--the contamination of food by components of the materials in contact with it. In this area, both technology and regulations are well developed, but basic science, for a variety of reasons, has tended to advance less quickly. This book addresses the basic science of migration. The editor has brought together a range of authors, all of whom are acknowledged experts in their fields, to provide a timely and concise overview of this important topic.

Hayes Patrick,"'Anti-illusionism is, I suspect, only a marking of time, a phase of recuperation, in the history of the novel. The question is, what next?' (J.M. Coetzee) Patrick Hayes argues that the significance of Coetzees fiction lies in the acuity with which it both explores and develops the tradition of the novelranging from Cervantes, Defoe, and Richardson to Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Beckettas part of a sustained attempt to rethink the relationship between writing and politics. For Coetzee, questions about the future of the novel are closely related to what it means to write after Beckett, and J. M. Coetzee and the Novel examines the ways in whichhis fiction discerningly assimilates the techniques of literary modernism to engage with some of the most troubling aspects of late twentieth-century cultural and political life. While Coetzee is rightly known as an intensely serious writer, Hayes shows that the true seriousness of his writing is intimately bound up with comedyor, to use the word Coetzee borrows from Joyce, the jocoserious. Opening up a range of new approaches to this major contemporary author, J. M.

In particular, the book investigates Intrabody Communication considering limb joint effects within the transmission frequency range 0.3-200 MHz. Based on in-vivo experiments which determine the effects of size, situations, and locations of joints on the IBC, the book proposes a new IBC circuit model explaining elbow joint effects. This model not only takes the limb joint effects of the body into account but also considers the influence of measurement equipment in higher frequency band thus predicting signal attenuation behavior over wider frequency ranges.

This meeting, which took place January 5-7, 1981 at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, had the same name as these Proceedings: Applied Probability-Computer Science, the Interface. The goal of that conference was to achieve a meeting of, and a cross fertilization between, two groups of researchers who, from different starting points, had come to work on similar problems, often developing similar methodologies and tools. One of these groups are the applied probabilists, many of whom consider their field an offspring of mathematics, and who find their motivation in many areas of application. The other is that group of computer scientists who, over the years, have found an increasing need in their work for the use of probabilistic models. The most visible area of common methodology between these two groups is networks of queues, Hhich by itself could have been the theme of an entire conference. FunctionQl areas which are, or are becoming, sources of exciting problems are computer performance analysis, data base analysis, analysis of communication protocols, data networks, and mixed voice-data telephone networks. The reader can add to this list by going through the papers in these Proceedings.",Science  ,Applied Probability-Computer Science: The Interface Volume 1
Irwin Marilyn,"An estimated 1 in 110 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although the public awareness of autism has grown significantly, teens are not as educated about this subject as they should be. When accurately and positively presented, literature has been shown to help the classmates of those with ASD better understand the disorder. Increased familiarity with the subject will, in turn, help foster acceptance.In Autism in Young Adult Novels: An Annotated Bibliography, Marilyn Irwin, Annette Y. Goldsmith, and Rachel Applegate identify and assess teen fiction with autism content. In the first section, the authors analyze how characters with ASD are presented. Where do they live and go to school? Do they have friends? Do they have good relationships with their family? How are they treated by others? The authors also consider whether autism is accurately presented. This discussion is followed by a comprehensive bibliography of books that feature a character identified as being on the autism spectrum. The novels reviewed in this volume date as far back as the late 1960s and include works published in the last few years. As more and more authors of young adult fiction become sensitive to ASD, they are featuring such characters in their novels, creating more realistic works for their readers. This study will help librarians and others collect, choose, evaluate, and use these works to educate young adults.",Juvenile Nonfiction  ,Autism in Young Adult Novels

Thackeray William Makepeace,"The quintessential satire of life in early nineteenth-century Britain, Vanity Fair is a panoramic tour of English social strata, charting the rise and fall of the opportunistic Becky Sharp. Rejected by several publishers before finding a place with Bradbury and Evans, this 'novel without a hero' first appeared as a popular serial. The twenty parts were finally printed together in 1848, incorporating the author's own illustrations. Although William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-63) was not a debut author, this was the first of his works to bear his name on the title page; the vast scope of the novel gained him immediate critical acclaim, though reviewers often expressed misgivings about the dark portrayal of human nature. In response, Thackeray wrote that 'we are for the most part an abominably foolish and selfish people ... I want to leave everybody dissatisfied and unhappy at the end of the story.'",Literary Criticism  ,Cambridge Library Collection - Fiction and Poetry: Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero
Caton L.,"Using romantic theories, Caton analyzes America's contemporary novel. Organized through the two sections of ""Theory"" and ""Practice,"" Reading American Novels and Multicultural Aesthetics begins with a study of aesthetic form only to have it reveal the content of politics and history. This presentation immediately offers a unified platform for an interchange between multiple cultural and aesthetic positions. Romantic theory provides for an integrated examination of diversity, one that metaphorically fosters a solid, inclusive, and democratic legitimacy for intercultural communication. This politically astute cosmopolitan appreciation will generate an intriguing ""cross-over"" audience: from ethnic studies to American studies and from literary studies to romantic studies, this book will interest a range of readers.",Literary Criticism  ,Reading American Novels and Multicultural Aesthetics

The many forms and flavors of these dispersions of tiny air bubbles, ice crystals, fat globules and casein micelles in thick, sweet-flavored syrup have the potential to provide the human sensory receptors with the highest levels of enjoyment.

Emphases have been placed on newest technologies and developments in science that affect the ice cream industry.

Vlock Deborah,"Dickens' novels, like those of his contemporaries, are more explicitly indebted to the theatre than scholars have supposed: his stories and characters were often already public property by the time they were published, circulating as part of a current theatrical repertoire well known to many Victorian readers. In this 1998 study, Deborah Vlock argues that novels - and novel-readers - were in effect created by the popular theatre in the nineteenth century, and that the possibility of reading and writing narrative was conditioned by the culture of the stage. Vlock resuscitates the long-dead voices of Dickens' theatrical sources, which now only tentatively inhabit reviews, scripts, fiction and non-fiction narratives, but which were everywhere in Dickens' time: voices of noted actors and actresses and of popular theatrical characters. She uncovers unexpected precursors for some popular Dickensian characters, and reconstructs the conditions in which Dickens' novels were initially received.",Literary Criticism  ,"Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture: Dickens, Novel Reading, and the Victorian Popular Theatre Series Number 19"

Chambers Robert W.,"With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies. 'I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled with horror which at all times assails me yet'. With its strange, imaginative blend of horror, science fiction, romance and lyrical prose, Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow is a classic masterpiece of weird fiction.

An air of futility and doom pervade these pages like a sweet insidious poison. Dare you read it?

Shakespeare William,"Edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, M.A., Ph.D., Emeritus Professor of English, University of Sussex. The Wordsworth Classics' Shakespeare Series presents a newly-edited sequence of William Shakespeare's works. The textual editing takes account of recent scholarship while giving the material a careful reappraisal. The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeare's most popular comedies, but it remains deeply controversial.The text may seem anti-Semitic; yet repeatedly, in performance, it has revealed a contrasting nature.Shylock, though vanquished in the law-court, often triumphs in the theatre. In his intensity he can dominatethe play, challenging abrasively its romantic and lyrical affirmations. What results is a bitter-sweet drama. Though The Merchant of Venice offers some of the traditional pleasures of romantic comedy, it also exposesthe operations of prejudice. Thus Shakespeare remains our contemporary.",Drama  ,The Merchant of Venice
